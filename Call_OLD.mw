== Warning ==
Calling is under development and not ready for end-users jet. Esspecially the "echo1 > /proc/pcap" might '''damage''' your phone, since I wrote this patch blindly with values I found on the Mailing List without knowing what they mean.

== Purpose of this small howto ==
Showing that calling with audio works, but nicer integration into the kernel is necessary. DEVELOPERS WANTED.

== Prerequisites ==
I assume you have a working userspace installed. I assume you know how to build a kernel.
* Linux Kernel; 2.6.23 and 2.6.24 should work.
*# Apply the patches from svn.openezx.org
*# Apply [http://lists.openezx.org/pipermail/openezx-devel/attachments/20071230/e96a2c71/ezx-pcap-ugly-proc-interface.bin this] ugly patch to enable pcap-writes from userspace
* /angstrom/build/tmp/cross/bin/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi-gcc -o openbpaudio [http://lists.openezx.org/pipermail/openezx-devel/attachments/20080217/11fa8244/openbpaudio.c openbpaudio.c]
* minicom: ipkg install minicom

== Calling ==
login 4 times (terminal1-terminal4) to your phone
 terminal-1$ killall ezxd;
 terminal-1$ cat /dev/mux0

 terminal-2$ minicom
Now use the menu to configure minicom. It should talk to /dev/mux4. 115200 8n1 work fine.

 ate1
This tells the BP to echo the characters we enter.

 AT+CPIN=1,"XXXX"
Replace XXXX with your PIN

 ATDXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Replace XXXXXXX with the number you want to call.
Now it should ring on the other side of the line.

 ATH
Hangup.

 +CLIP: "XXXXXXXXXX",129
If you see this on terminal1 (the one where you did cat /dev/mux0), it meens you are recieving a call.

 ATA
Accept the call.


== Audio on Calls ==
So far we manged to make calls, but without sound. This is because the internal audio routing needs setup.

After ATDXXXXX(or ATA):
 terminal-3$ openbpaudio
Yes, the tiny tool we compiled before. It just does an open("/dev/snd/pcmC0D2p", O_RDONLY);

 terminal-4$ echo1 > /proc/pcap
Setting PCAP-Registers. That's why we needed an extra kernel-patch above.

And now, it still might not work.

 terminal-4$ echo1 > /proc/pcap
 terminal-3$ openbpaudio
 terminal-4$ echo1 > /proc/pcap

Yust repeat, and now you should get audio in both directions.
