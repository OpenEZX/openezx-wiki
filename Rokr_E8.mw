The Motorola ROKR E8 is a Linux-based music phone from Motorola.

Screen Resolution:  320x240 (landscape)

Unique Features:  The E8 features a "morphing keypad".  Basically, different lights under the keypad illuminate to display different functions.   When in "phone" mode, the standard keypad appears.  When in "music" mode, the illumination changes so that the keypad appears to be replaced with music function buttons.
