=Getting Drivers and Tools=
You will need various tools to pull this off, some of which aren't on your phone

For loading your drivers, I personally recomend NEO-Installer unless you have flashed your firmware to allow you to execute code when the phone boots up  (which is next on my list).  I install my drivers under /exzlocal/modules.  With NEO-Installer, you can put any number of scripts in the directory /ezxlocal/download/QTDownLoad/Startup and they will be executed when NEO-Installer starts.  Note that they are only called once each time the phone boots even if you run the NEO-Installer script multiple times.

This is what my /ezxlocal/download/QTDownLoad/Startup/modules script looks like:

 #!/bin/bash
 
 # Load modules for ext2 and ext3
 cd /ezxlocal/modules
 insmod /ezxlocal/modules/jbd.o
 insmod /ezxlocal/modules/ext2.o
 insmod /ezxlocal/modules/ext3.o
 
 # Mount main Transflash partition
 mount /dev/mmca1 /mmc/mmca1
 
 # Create device for swap partition and turn it on.
 mknod /tmp/mmca2 b 243 2
 swapon /tmp/mmca2
