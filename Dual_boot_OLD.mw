== HOWTO GET A DUAL BOOT SYSTEM ON YOUR A780 ==


NOTE: This is time demanding. I used allmost two hours just to flash the phone. It also take some time to backup your phone.

This guide will give you the opportunity to:

  * boot the original ezx rootfs as normal
  * boot openezxkernel with rootfs on the Transflash card with pushing the cam button for a few sec.
  * boot openezxkernel as allways with usb-boot and rootfs on the Transflash card. 

REQUIREMENTS:

On your host: cramfs-tools

On your A780: mtd-utils [ It's included in console-a780-mtd-image.tar.bz2, if you use another image be sure to install it, because it is included by default ]
			
For yourself: Guts :-), mabye a beer if your overage, something to read and a backup-phone is something goes wrong :-( . 

As allways:

Remember, this might break your device, i am not responsable if something happends.
I just do this for fun, and i dont see the point of not sharing this.

<b>YOU DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISC</b>

Thanks to openezx developers, Openembedded community and motorolafans for letting us do all this geeky stuff.

HOWTO_FLASH_A780.TXT 			[This readme]

boot_usb				[Normal usb booter]

boot_usb-blop2				[The usb booter you should use after flashing your phone]

console-a780-mtd-image.tar.bz2		[A linux rootfs image including mtd-utils]

zImage-2.6.23-1-mtd-a780		[The usual openezx kernel image to use for backup your phone]	

zImage-2.6.23-1-mtd-a780-alternate	[The openezx kernel zImage to use for flashing your phone and after flashing the phone, next time you want to upgrade your 
					zImage just be sure that the zImage includes mtd-a780-alternate ] 


== STEP BY STEP GUIDE ==

1) Charge your battery full [very important]

2) Backup your partions on your A780:
	
[Boot Linux with zImage-2.6.23-1-mtd-a780 and ssh to the phone from your computer]

[Computer as root]:
	ssh 192.168.0.202
[A780]:
	mkdir -p /backup/original
	cat /proc/mtd

[it should give you this output:]

dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 00020000 00008000 "Bootloader"
mtd1: 000e0000 00020000 "Kernel"
mtd2: 018e0000 00020000 "rootfs"
mtd3: 00580000 00020000 "VFM_Filesystem"
mtd4: 00020000 00020000 "setup"
mtd5: 00020000 00020000 "Logo"
root@a780:/$

[Then backup your filesystem]

	if=/dev/mtd0 of=/backup/original/mtd0 [it might give you "Illegal instruction" at the end as it did with me, but it's OK]
        if=/dev/mtd1 of=/backup/original/mtd1 [it might give you "Illegal instruction" at the end as it did with me, but it's OK]
        if=/dev/mtd2 of=/backup/original/mtd2 [it might give you "Illegal instruction" at the end as it did with me, but it's OK]
        if=/dev/mtd3 of=/backup/original/mtd3 [it might give you "Illegal instruction" at the end as it did with me, but it's OK]
        if=/dev/mtd4 of=/backup/original/mtd4 [it might give you "Illegal instruction" at the end as it did with me, but it's OK]
        if=/dev/mtd5 of=/backup/original/mtd5 [it might give you "Illegal instruction" at the end as it did with me, but it's OK]
	sync
	reboot

3) Save the files in the backup folder to your computer

[Computer as root]:
	mkdir /media/transflash
	mount -t ext2 /dev/sda2 /media/transflash [I'll assume that the block device of the TRANSFLASH card is called /dev/sda. Replace this with the correct device on your system] 		
	mkdir -p ~/a780/original
	mkdir -p ~/a780/resized
	mkdir 
	cp /media/transflash/backup/original/* ~/a780/original/
	cd ~/a780/resized/
	cp ~/a780/original/mtd1 moto-kernel.mtd2
	wget http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/00020000.bin
	mv ~/a780/resized/00020000.bin bootloader2.mtd1
	wget http://linuxtogo.org/~goxboxlive/zImage-2.6.23-1-mtd-a780-alternate
	mv zImage-2.6.23-1-mtd-a780-alternate openezx-kernel.mtd4

4) We are now going to resize the original rootfs.

[Computer as root]:
	mkdir /mtn/mtd2
	mount -o loop -t cramfs /~home/a780/mtd2 /mnt/cramfs
	cd /mnt/cramfs
	tar cf ../mtd2.tar *
	mkdir /tmp/mtd2
	tar xpf mtd2.tar -C /tmp/mtd2
	cd /tmp/mtd2
	rm usr/sbin/smbd [you will miss samba and wouldnt be able to browse your files on A780 from windows (i think,dont know for sure)] 
	pico etc/init.d/samba [Use your favorit texteditor, i am using "pico": Comment out line with # that includes smbd in section (start and (restart] exit with [ctrl + o] +  [enter] + [ctrl + x] [enter]
	rm usr/SYSqtapp/wvimps/wvimps [WVIMPS is Wirelless Village Instant Messenger. It is present on all stock firmwares, but do not show on the Main Menu. There are a few people who have tried to make it work, but it doesnt. So what a heck, just delete it.]
	cd ..
	mkcramfs mtd2 mtd2.rootfs.mtd3	[We use .mtd3 endig because this should now be flashed to mtd3 instead of mtd2] 
	umount /tmp/mtd2
	cp mtd2.edited.mtd3 ~/a780/resized/
	cd ~/a780/resized/
	mkdir /media/transflash/backup/resized
	cp * /media/transflash/backup/resized/
	sync
	umount /media/transflash

5) Power on your A780 and charge it full again [very important]

6) Now we need to boot up linux again on A780, but now with a diffrent kernel for flashing your phone :-) (scary) 

[Boot Linux with zImage-2.6.23-1-mtd-a780-alternate  and ssh to the phone from your computer]

[Computer]:
        ssh 192.168.0.202
[A780]
	cat /proc/mtd

[it should give you this output:]

dev:    size   erasesize  name
mtd0: 00020000 00008000 "Bootloader (RO)"
mtd1: 00020000 00020000 "Bootloader 2"
mtd2: 000e0000 00020000 "Moto Kernel"
mtd3: 01760000 00020000 "rootfs"
mtd4: 00180000 00020000 "OpenEZX Kernel"
mtd5: 005a0000 00020000 "ezxlocal"
mtd6: 00020000 00020000 "setup"
mtd7: 00020000 00020000 "Logo"
root@a780:~$

[To save battery before we start to flash turn off your backlight so the battery last longer]
	
	echo "0" > /sys/class/backlight/ezx-bl/brightness
	
[Now flash your phone it might take up to two hours as it did for me, important fully charged battery (i cant say this enough) ]

	flash_unlock /dev/mtd1
	flash_eraseall /dev/mtd1
	flashcp bootloader2.mtd1 /dev/mtd1
	flash_unlock /dev/mtd2
	flash_eraseall /dev/mtd2
	flashcp moto-kernel.mtd2 /dev/mtd2
        flash_unlock /dev/mtd3
        flash_eraseall /dev/mtd3
        flashcp /tmp/mtd2.rootfs.mtd3 /dev/mtd3  [Yes this is correct, mtd2.rootfs.mtd3 is going to mtd3 now because of the extra bootloader, this step take over an hour]
	flash_unlock /dev/mtd4
	flash_eraseall /dev/mtd4
	flashcp openezx-kernel.mtd4 /dev/mtd4
	sync
	reboot
7)

Now your done, reboot the phone and test out the original evnirement with normal power on.

8)

Now, test to boot the openezx kernel. Swithc off phone and then held the cam button for a few sec, it should boot openezx.

9)

To boot openezx from usb mode you will have to use the boot_usb-blop2 instead of the useuall one. 


10)

Next time there is an update of the openezx kernel and you want to update, you will just have to flash /dev/mtd4. 
Just be sure that it inlcudes mtd-a780-alternate.
But you will need to boot from usb-boot to do this, not with the cam button boot.

        flash_unlock /dev/mtd4
        flash_eraseall /dev/mtd4
        flashcp openezx-NEW-kernel.mtd4 /dev/mtd4 


TROUBLESHOOTING:

No idea, it just went successfully for me, so i didnt need to do any troubleshooting :-) .
