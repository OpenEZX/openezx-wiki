= General =

On this site we start to share information about the ezx bootloader. Motorola released the modified [[blob]] for the ezx phones. The source is available here: http://www.datenfreihafen.org/~stefan/EZX/a780-blob.tar.bz2

Enter bootloader:

* '''A780:''' press camera and jogdial(scrollwheel) button while power on. 
* '''E680(i):''' press camera and volume down button while power on.

= Communication with the bootloader =

Based on the source code [[User:LaF0rge|Harald Welte]] wrote a userspace application for communication with the bootloader over USB. At the moment you can use it to load a selfcompiled kernel into RAM and execute it. This gives the possibility to test kernels without having to reflash the phone again and again. [[boot_usb]] is available here: http://svn.gnumonks.org/trunk/a780/src/boot_usb/. You need [http://libusb.sourceforge.net/ libusb].

We have some problems where the flag values come from. [[Blob]], the bootloader, reads the flag value from the first four bytes of SDRAM. The question is who wrote these bytes into the SDRAM?  The only corresponding value we can find in the kernel source code is 0x7c7c7c7c. Perhaps last ones are garbage and have no real meaning, 0x95aa95aa is reproducible.

= RESET =

The reset value seems to be 0x00000001. More information needed here.

= BRESET =

The reset value seems to be 0x00000000. More information needed here.

= ARESET =

The reset value seems to be 0x00000000. More information needed here.

= Messages =

We have discovered two messages at the moment:

* No BP_WDI before reset start reflash code!
* start reflash code!

= Version and date =

Version 3.0 from 2004-05-18

If you get another version and date on your phone please add here.
