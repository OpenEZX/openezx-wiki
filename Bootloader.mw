= General =
On this site we start to share information about the ezx bootloader. Motorola released the modified blob for the ezx phones. The source is available here: http://www.datenfreihafen.org/~stefan/EZX/a780-blob.tar.bz2

To enter the bootloader you need to press the camera and jogdial button while power on. 

= Communication with the bootloader =

Based on the source code Harald Welte wrote a userspace application for communication with the bootloader over usb. At the moment you can use it to load a selfcompiled kernel into ram and execute it. This gives the possibility to test kernels without reflash the phone again and again. boot_usb is available here: http://svn.gnumonks.org/trunk/a780/src/boot_usb/ . You need libusb.

| With this flag loading kernel into ram and boot works. 
|-
| 0x95aa95aa
| Need to fill.
| A possible meaning of this this value is low power. Booting kernel via usb does not work.
