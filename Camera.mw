The A780 camera is a OmniVision OV9640 1.3MegaPixel Camera Module. It is directly attached to the AP.

Looks like there are multiple camera modules..
My a780 reports a [http://www.datasheetarchive.com/search.php?q=MT9M111 mt9m111] Camera module on the 2.4 dmesg. - WyrM


The E680 features an Agilent ADCM2700 VGA camera module (this is the one of the three cameras which is said to not have a public datasheet available, thanks Agilent). It is attached to I2C bus (2.4 driver says it's address 0x53) and AP (via PXA Camera Interface, e.g. register CICR0). I'm suspecting that it might be this camera when powered down which is blocking my i2c bus (FM radio at 0x60, FM amplifier at 0x7c, lots of i2c timeouts without any interrupts), but without datasheet it's rather harder to decipher.
