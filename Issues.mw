== A780 ==

=== The phone does not charge with the USB data cable ===

Perhaps your phone is completely discharged. At this point you need to use the USB power supply. Take a look at [[A780#Charging_modes]].

=== The phone does not charge on my USB hub ===

The device you connect your phone to must supply about 500 mA (milliamps). When plugged into a keyboard with a built-in USB (for example), the phone will not charge (Windows will notify you of this). This is because the keyboard does not provide power. Other devices may provide power, e.g. so-called self-powered hubs.

== A910 == 

=== The mmc isn't working well ===

The A910's mmc module isn't wired the same way it is on the other EZX phones, and there is some problems with it's driver.

[http://people.openezx.org/ao2/tmp/mmc_spi_share_cs.patch This patch] is a temporary fix that works at least on 2.6.28, but might be also the cause of some datas corruptions sometimes...

Even with this hack the recent versions of that "mmc_spi.c" driver generate a lot of errors while reading the cards.

UPDATE: at that time, it seems that there is a solution and spi sharing has been reported to work afair ( see http://www.mail-archive.com/openezx-devel@lists.openezx.org/msg02650.html )

==Genblob error messages and causes:==

===Cannot find MMC card===
This could be there is no mmc card or there is an unsupported mmc/sd card in the phone.
in any case this cannot be a partitionning problem, this warning happens before the partition/filesytem checks.
Cannot load kernel from: /boot/default===
Check your partition type/formating , re-check /boot/menu.lst and the files placed in /boot/ . default must be a valid kernel, of course.
===No suitable kernel entry===
Could be the same as above. if nothing works, delete and re-create the parts, reformat, and rebuild /boot/

==moto-boot-usb error messages and causes:==

===FAILED: params upload failed=== 
This appear when moto-boot-usb cannot send parameter, try sending genblob first (at least in its usb mode, from moto-boot-usb).

It can also be your kernel, that is too old, and maybe don't support CMDLINE overidding.

Make sure you have a recent moto-boot-usb, too (the ones on angstrom's website is very old).

===FAILED: RSQN===
This is known to appear on gen1 devices, you need to unplug/plug the usb cable after sending genblob (at the step you see "USB READY" on the phone).

===FAILED: claim usb interface 1 of device: could not claim interface 0: Operation not permitted===
Maybe make sure to be root or type sudo before the command??
