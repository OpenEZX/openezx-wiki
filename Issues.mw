== A780 ==

'''Problem:''' The phone does not charge with the USB data cable.

'''Solution:''' Perhaps your phone is completely discharged. At this point you need to use the USB power supply. Take a look at [[Hardware::A780#Charging_modes]].

===USB Hubs===
The device you connect your phone  to must supply about 550ma (milliamps).  When I plug my A780 into a keyboard I have with a built-in USB, the phone will not charge.  (In windoze, you will recieve notification of this.)
