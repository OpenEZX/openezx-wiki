== A780 ==

=== The phone does not charge with the USB data cable ===

Perhaps your phone is completely discharged. At this point you need to use the USB power supply. Take a look at [[A780#Charging_modes]].

=== The phone does not charge on my USB hub ===

The device you connect your phone to must supply about 500 mA (milliamps). When plugged into a keyboard with a built-in USB (for example), the phone will not charge (Windows will notify you of this). This is because the keyboard does not provide power. Other devices may provide power, e.g. so-called self-powered hubs.

== A910 == 

=== The mmc isn't working well ===

The A910's mmc isn't wired the same way it is on the other EZX phones, and there is some problems with it's driver.
Even with this hack the recent versions of that "mmc_spi.c" driver generate a lot of errors while reading the cards.

==Genblob error messages and causes:==

===Cannot find MMC card===
This could be there is no mmc card or there is an unsupported mmc/sd card in the phone.
in any case this cannot be a partitionning problem, this warning happens before the partition/filesytem checks.
Cannot load kernel from: /boot/default===
Check your partition type/formating , re-check /boot/menu.lst and the files placed in /boot/ . default must be a valid kernel, of course.
===No suitable kernel entry===
Could be the same as above. if nothing works, delete and re-create the parts, reformat, and rebuild /boot/

==BootUsb error messages and causes:==

===FAILED: params upload failed=== 
This appear when bootusb cannot send parameter, try sending genblob first (at least in its usb mode, from bootusb).

It can also be your kernel, that is too old, and maybe don't support CMDLINE overidding.

Make sure you have a recent bootusb, too (the ones on angstrom's website is very old).

===FAILED: RSQN===
This is known to appear on gen1 devices, you need to unplug/plug the usb cable after sending genblob (at the step you see "USB READY" on the phone).

===FAILED: claim usb interface 1 of device: could not claim interface 0: Operation not permitted===
Maybe make sure to be root or type sudo before the command??
