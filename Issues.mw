=== The phone does not charge with the USB data cable ===

Perhaps your phone is completely discharged. At this point you need to use the USB power supply. Take a look at [[Hardware::A780#Charging_modes]].

=== The phone does not charge on my USB hub ===

The device you connect your phone to must supply about 500 mA (milliamps). When plugged into a keyboard with a built-in USB (for example), the phone will not charge (Windows will notify you of this). This is because the keyboard does not provide power. Other devices may provide power, e.g. so-called self-powered hubs.
