The E680 is pretty much the same like the [[Hardware::A780|A780]].  

This page will therefore only describe the differences between the A780 and the E680.

== SD/MMC ==

As opposed to the A780 TransFlash slot, the E680 has a real SD/MMC card slot. You can use a SD/MMC adapter with a TransFlash.

== Camera ==

The E680 features an Agilent ADCM2700 VGA camera module. It is attached to the I2C and AP.

== Sound ==

Sound hardware is a LM4857 from National Semiconductors. It is attached to the I2C and PCAP2.

== FM Radio ==

The E680 has an FM radio that is controlled via I2C.

== Keypad ==

Since the E680 doesn't have a flip, it is missing the respective keypad. Instead, it has 7 buttons, a cursor keypad and a lock screen switch.

== LEDs ==

One multicolor LED attached to PCAP2 and AP. One blue cursor pad LED attached to AP (via TC_MM_EN).

== no GPS ==
