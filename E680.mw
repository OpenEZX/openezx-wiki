The E680 is pretty much the same like the [[Hardware::A780|A780]].  

This page will therefore only describe the differences between the A780 and the E680.

== SD/MMC ==

As opposed to the A780 TransFlash slot, the E680 has a real SD/MMC card slot.You can use a SD/MMC adapter with a TransFlash.

== Sound ==

Sound hardware is said to be controlled by the "boomer" driver (not working yet in the ezx kernel source as of 20060608),
so audio chipset is likely to be LM4934 from National Semiconductors.

== FM Radio ==

The E680 has an FM radio that is controlled via I2C.

== Keypad ==

Since the E680 doesn't have a flip, it is missing the respective keypad.

== GPS ==

The E680 doesn't have GPS.
