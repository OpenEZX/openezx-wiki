The '''E680''' is from a hard- and software point very similar to the [[A780]], although there are some differences. It doesn't have a flip and you have a SD card slot instead a microSD. The E680 is only known to be sold in Asia.

This page will therefore only describe the differences between the [[A780]] and the E680.
