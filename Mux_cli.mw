Mux_cli is an implementation of the 27.010 protocol

[http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/27010.htm] 3GPP spec


'''Additions'''

Motorola has made a couple of proprietary additions to the standard 27.010 basic protocol.


1. Sequence number & ack

After every receive the AP sends an ack with the sequence number for the next frame
for the BP to use (the sequence number wraps back to zero upon reaching 4).

This addition is unusual for a 27.010 implementation and appears to be a deliberate
mechanism to limit the throughput of the link, potentially a problem with the UART.

  4f = ack command

  Example AP ack frame (flag,dlc(0),ack,len(1),seqnumber(2),crc,flag)
  f9 03 4f 03 02 94 f9


2. Command & Data identification

The advantage of using your own silicon, you can specify enhancements. This simple
addition of command or data enables the driver to quickly interpret and route
the user packet.

  Command tag 0x55
  Data tag 0XAA

'''Current status'''

USB mux code untested due to difficulties with establishing the USB connection to the baseband

The AP works as host. Need to establish hub, dmesg output similar to

  usb.c: registered new driver hub
  ochi_addr = 0xd1239000
  usb-ohci.c: USB OHCI at membase 0xd1239000, IRQ 3

Current focus on the monitoring of GPIO 41 (BP is active)

  hub.c usb_hub_port_connect_change  (wakeup BP patch)


'''Diagrams'''

The following diagrams use Alessandro Rubini's notation to describe the structure and flows [http://www.linux.it/~rubini/docs/serial/serial.html]. 


'''TODO - coming soon'''

diagram showing frame definitions

flows within the 2.4 driver

alterations done for 2.6 - work queues & Alan Cox's replacement of tty flip buffers 

Potential future - mux line discipline (will enable use of any tty_driver derived driver)
