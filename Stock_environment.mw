= Software overview (A780-E680)=

*MontaVista "mobilinux" additions
*dynamic power management
*EZX arm subarchitecture
*low-level drivers for:
**SPI/SSP
**PCAP Audio (mono/stereo/headset/...)
**Vibrator (/dev/vibrator)
**USB host port attached to BP
**USB device port (belcarra usbd, not gadget)
**Transflash/SD/MMC
*THREE proprietary flash file systems
**Intel VFM (hatcreek.o)
**m-systems DiskOnChip (tffs.o)
**third unknown
*A1200 and ROKR E2 have custom Selinux static kernel module called [[motoac]]

The modified Linux kernel used on the Motorola Linux phones has been released by Motorola on SourceForge:
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/a760/
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/e680/

Multiple versions are available:
* [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=116309&package_id=126302&release_id=259130 linux_kernel_a760_2.tar.bz2] seems to be based on Linux 2.4.18, and was uploaded to SourceForge on 2004-08-09.
** Judging from ''drivers/misc/ezx-log.c'' it seems to contain code for the [[A760]] only.
* [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=142482&package_id=156813&release_id=339095 original_kernel.tar.gz] seems to be based on Linux 2.4.20, and was uploaded to SourceForge on 2005-07-01.
** Judging from ''drivers/misc/ezx-log.c'' it seems to contain code for the [[A760]], [[E680]], and [[A780]]
* [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=142482&package_id=156813&release_id=383388 original_kernel_2.tar.gz] seems to be based on Linux 2.4.20, and was uploaded to SourceForge on 2006-01-06.
** Judging from ''drivers/misc/ezx-log.c'' it seems to contain code for the [[A760]], [[E680]], and [[A780]].

The Linux Kernel running on (most) EZX smartphones is a 2.4.20 based kernel, with the following modifications:

* Lots of hardware (cpu/architecture) related patches to mips/ppc/arm from MontaVista
* Drivers for
** PXA270 Dynamic Power Management
** PXA270 SD/MMC Controller (depending on firmware version statically linked !!)
** Camera (v4l2 driver)
** Keypad
** Buttons
** PXA270 Framebuffer
** PXA270 Touchscreen
** IPC (AP<->BP) USB Host
** USB Device (Belcarra usbd, _not_ the Linux gadget driver)
* Proprietary kernel modules for
** USB IPC demultiplex ([[mux_cli]])
** GPRS (gprsv)
** Intel VFM (hatcreek) flash file system
*** Generic code is released by Intel upon request, but not GPL-compatible
** MSystems TrueFFS (tffs) flash file system
*** Acts as a translation layer between VFAT and the underlying flash device
*** vfat is only required to achieve USB mass storage compatibility for Windows boxes
** Logging/testing of AP, BP and DSP (logger)


==Modules==

===mux_cli.o===
*hooks into special functions of USB host driver
*provides GSM TS07.10 (de)multiplex
*userspace has tty devices

===gprsv.o===
*implements GPRS line discipline for mux_cli ttys
*hooks into netfilter to intercept DNS packets ?!?
*provides gprs0 / grps1 network devices

===ipsec.o===
*proprietary ipsec stack (don't we already have two GPL licensed?)
*Copyright Certicom Corp

==Libraries==
*glibc

===Bluetooth===
*proprietary userspace program directly opens HCI

===[[GPS]]===
*no NMEA, no serial device emulation :(
*proprietary library via mux_cli kernel module

===UI===
*embeddedQt
*Motorola EZX toolkit
*Low-level devices (framebufffer, etc) accessable.


==[[Bootloader]]==

*EZX bootloader
*based on GPL licensed blob
*low-level initialization code (GPIO config, clock, ...)
*vendor specific USB device allows for:
**transfer of executable code from USB host
**execution of transferred executable
*serial console code is present in binary (but not used)
*PST/RSD firmware updates work by uploading a "ramloader"
