=Some details about the mpkg package format used for EZX=

To make a long story short the mpkg package is just a renamed tar.gz with
special directory structure, filenames and icons.
In this small example we will package a program called foobar.

==Directory structure==

* The archive must contain a directory with the name of the application.
* All files are placed under the directory.

==The .desktop file==

* You need a file called foobar/foobar.desktop

 [Desktop Entry] 
 BigIcon=foobar.png  ''Big icon''
 Comment=Foo Bar     ''Comment''
 Exec=foobar         ''Executable''
 Icon=foobar-sm.png  ''Small icon''
 Name=foobar         ''Program name''
 Version=0.1         ''???''
 OsVersion=1.1       ''???''
 Shared=2            ''Where you seen icon (User1, Extra, Gamesetc.''
 Type=Application    ''What other types are available?''
                     ''1=Sub-menu, 2=Application, 3=Browser App(?),''
                     ''4=?(uses Action registry to launch possilby dual-use apps, such''
                     ''as SYSqtapp/camera/camera, which is used for both still''
                     ''and video capture, but are separate icons in the UI)''

If your target ezx device supports animated icons:

 AniIcon=anim.gif    ''Animated gif used when icon gains focus''

Other (optional) entries (may not be supported on all ezx platforms):

 Args={arguments}    ''Arguments passed to Exec''
 Visible=[0|1]       ''Application is visible to user(?)''
 Url=[http URL]      ''For Type==3''
 Action=[Reg Name]   ''For Type==4''
 LockEnabled=[0|1]   ''??''

==Icons==

There are two different types of icons. The big and the small one.

* Resolution for big: 71 x 32, 8-bit/color
* Resolution for small: 32 x 15, 8-bit/color

=Create a package=

 tar -czf foobar.mpkg --numeric-owner --owner=2000 --group=233 foobar

NOTE:  At least the app manager for the ROKR E2 in version 45P preserves the tar files' uid and gid attributes (but not permissions).  When installing to the memory card this should not make any difference, as FAT does not support uid or gid attributes.  However, when installing to the phone's memory (/ezxlocal), this can prohibit application write access to the installed directory if 'ezx' is not the owner.

=Install a package=

'''A780:''' This phone can handle mpkg natively. European phones have MPKG installer disabled. A special MPKG installer or flashed phone is required. I don't know if the same is aplicable for Asian A780's

'''E680:''' You need an mpkg installer for this phone. (Someone with E680 please fill up.)

Just tap inside the file manager on the package and you will be asked for installation.

The package gets installed to '''.system/QTDownLoad/foobar'''.

=Remove a package=

You can remove the package inside the normal deinstallation menu.
