=Some details about the mpkg package format used for EZX=

To make a long story short the mpkg package is just a renamed tar.gz with
special directory structure, filenames and icons.
In this small example we will package a program called foobar.

==Directory structure==

* The archive must contain a directory with the name of the application.
* All files are placed under the directory.

==The .desktop file==

* You need a file called foobar/foobar.desktop

 [Desktop Entry] 
 BigIcon=foobar.png  ''Big icon''
 Comment=Foo Bar     ''Comment''
 Exec=foobar         ''Executable''
 Icon=foobar-sm.png  ''Small icon''
 Name=foobar         ''Program name''
 Version=0.1         ''???''
 OsVersion=1.1       ''???''
 Shared=2            ''Where you seen icon (User1, Extra, Gamesetc.''
 Type=Application    ''What other types are available?''

==Icons==

There are two different types of icons. The big and the small one.

* Resolution for big: 71 x 32, 8-bit/color
* Resolution for small: 32 x 15, 8-bit/color

=Create a package=

$ tar czf foobar.mpkg foobar

=Install a package=

'''A780:''' This phone can handle mpkg natively. European phones have MPKG installer disabled. A special MPKG installer or flashed phone is required. I don't know if the same is aplicable for Asian A780's

'''E680:''' You need an mpkg installer for this phone. (Someone with E680 please fill up.)

Just tap inside the file manager on the package and you will be asked for installation.

The package gets installed to '''.system/QTDownLoad/foobar'''.

=Remove a package=

You can remove the package inside the normal deinstallation menu.
