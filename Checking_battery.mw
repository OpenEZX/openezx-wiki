=Checking the battery's actual capacity on the 2.6 OpenEZX kernel=

On A780, (maybe on other gen1 devices) it seems:

 echo -e "AT+CBC\r\n" > /dev/mux4

On A910 and probably other gen2 devices:
 cat /sys/devices/platform/pxa2xx-spi.1/spi1.0/adc_battery
Or on newer kernels,
 cat /sys/class/power_supply/main-battery

Return the battery's informations
