Please notice that the development is still in an early state. You should know what you are doing, if you test this.

We are using [http://repo.or.cz/w/topgit.git topgit] to manage our patches in a git tree. Please make sure you have it installed before starting development.

The preferred toolchain for building the kernel is the openembedded toolchain (see [[Crosscompile]]).  However, it is still recommended that the kernel be built by hand (see instructions below) rather than using bitbake.

== Building OpenEZX kernel ==
* Get the kernel sources:
 git clone git://git.openezx.org/openezx.git

* Make the repo topgit aware
 cd openezx
 tg remote --populate origin

* Checkout our development branch:
 git checkout ezx/current

* Use the ezx_defconfig for the first build:
 cp arch/arm/configs/ezx_defconfig .config
 make ARCH=arm oldconfig

* Build the kernel:
 make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/angstrom/arm/bin/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi- zImage

* Update your tree later:
 git checkout master && git pull && tg remote --populate origin && git checkout ezx/current && tg update

*Build the modules (optional):
 make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/angstrom/arm/bin/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi- modules

*So we can install them:

...or like here, we will only make an archive from their folder, for installing them on any root filesystem later :

 mkdir /tmp/modules-of-the-day
 make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/angstrom/arm/bin/arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/tmp/modules-of-the-day modules_install
 tar -C /tmp/modules-of-the-day -c . | bzip2 > modules-of-the-day.tar.bz2
 # (you need to be root root or sudoing on some commands, or for installing them later, as you will need to untar them on the root folder on the target rootfs)

== Building OpenEZX kernel with openembedded ==
* Please note that OE uses a '''different .config''', and a patchset which '''does not necessarily ressemble the Official OpenEZX patchset''', Kernels built by OE are supported by OE people, at #oe on freenode or openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org. Please, dont ask OpenEZX developers (particularly WyrM) '''anything''' if you built your kernel with OE.

* Setup OE according to http://wiki.openembedded.net/index.php/Getting_Started
 * Note: Latest release of BitBake is required. Download it from http://developer.berlios.de/projects/bitbake/.
   Recommended way is running it without install.
 * Use <tt>MACHINE=a780</tt> and <tt>DISTRO=angstrom-2008.1</tt> in local.conf

* Run <tt>$ bitbake virtual/kernel</tt>

=== Notes ===
* The last command will fail if you have "." in your PATH
* the kernel expects the rootfs on the '''second''' partition of external flash (<tt>root=/dev/mmcblk0p2</tt>), with this setup you can use the first partition to store some data and access it when booting the original software (recently also kernels built by OE started to follow this convention).
* by default this '''second''' partition must be ext2 fs.

You can use the zImage together with [[Bootloader#Communication_with_the_bootloader|boot_usb]] to boot the phone with this kernel.
