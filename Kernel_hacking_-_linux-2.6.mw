The OpenEZX kernel tree bases on a [http://www.kernel.org vanilla 2.6 kernel]. At the moment we use 2.6.16.

We use [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt quilt] to handle our -ezx kernel tree. You can find the latest patchset [http://people.openezx.org/stefan/patches/patches-2.6.16-2.6.16.13-ezx7.tar.bz2 here].

Please notice that the development is still in an early state. You should know what you are doing, if you test this.

== Building OpenEZX kernel with ezx-crosstool ==

Obviously you need to get ezx-crosstool first. We have some information about how to [[Crosscompile|setup]].

Next step should be to get a vanilla kernel and our patchset.

With crosscompiler and patchset you should be able to compile new kernels with just this line:

 make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- zImage

If everything works fine you can find the zImage in arch/arm/boot/ . You can use this zImage together with [[Bootloader#Communication_with_the_bootloader|boot_usb]] to boot the phone with this kernel once.

== Building OpenEZX kernel with openembedded ==

* Setup OE according to http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/GettingStarted
* Use MACHINE=a780 and DISTRO=ezx
* 'bitbake virtual/kernel'
