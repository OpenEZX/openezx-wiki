The EZX kernel tree bases on a [http://www.kernel.org vanilla 2.6 kernel]. At the moment we use 2.6.16, but 2.6.17 is on the way.

We use quilt to handle our -ezx kernel tree. You can find the latest patchset [http://people.openezx.org/stefan/patches/patches-2.6.16-2.6.16.13-exz6-symlink-fix.tar.bz2 here].

Please notice that the development is still in an early state. You should know what you are doing, if you test this.

== Building EZX kernel with ezx-crosstool ==

Obviously you need to get ezx-crosstool first. We have some information about how to [[Corsscompile|setup].

Next step should be to get a vanilla kernel and our patchset.

With crosscompiler and patchset you should be able to compile new kernels with just this line:

make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- zImage

If everythings works fine you can find the zImage in arch/arm/boot/ . You can use this zImage together with boot_usb to boot the phone with this kernel once.


== Building EZX kernel with openembedded ==

Please fill up.


== Building kernel modules for the original motorola kernel ==

Change the EXTRAVERSION in kernel Makefile to _mvlcee30-mainstone instead of _pnail.

Steps:
Download the [http://www.motorolafans.com/index.php?name=Downloads&file=details&id=197 patch] for [http://sourceforge.net/projects/e680 kernel] from download->E680i/A780->scripts/programs section 

gzip -cd patch-2.4.17-pnail-0.1.gz | patch -p0<br>
cd linux-2.4.17<br>
cp arch/arm/def-configs/ezx-780 .config<br>
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- oldconfig<br>
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- dep<br>
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- zImage<br>
