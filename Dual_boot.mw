The first part of the tutorial has been tested only on Motorola A780.
Don't flash gen-blob on A910, it can't access MMC on this phone.

==What is gen-blob==

gen-blob is a second stage bootloader for the Motorola EZX phones, developed
by Daniel Ribeiro starting from the sources of the EZX version of 'blob'
bootloader released by Motorola.

It lets you have the phone with its BP (Baseband Processor) in
normal mode, this enables the use of GSM and several other services on EZX
phones (GPS, if available, and charging batteries, just to mention some).

It also enables multiboot, you can keep your original software and start
experimenting with the (too) many Free alternatives, loading kernels and
userspace software from the external SD/MMC card (let's simply call it MMC in
this document).

==Installing gen-blob==

===What's needed===

* gen-blob sources and a proper toolchain to build it, or alternatively an
  already compiled gen-blob, see here: http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/gen-blob/ 
* openezx kernel with MTD support and modules needed for vfat:
  http://people.openezx.org/ao2/snapshots/zImage-2.6.25-ezxdev-20081102-a780
  http://people.openezx.org/ao2/snapshots/modules-2.6.25-ezxdev-20081102-a780.tar.gz
* mtd-utils installed in the rootfs used with the openezx kernel

===Partitionig===

gen-blob expects a FAT16/FAT32 as the first partition on MMC card, it loads
the kernel from there, you could also use this partition as storage shared
between the original software and the alternative ones. The other partitions
should be choosen according to the requirements of the kernel you are going to
load.  Usually OpenEZX kernels expect an ext2 partition as the second one,
from which they load the rootfs.

For instance, here'a a possible directory layout needed by gen-blob in the
first partition:
  .
  `-- boot
      |-- menu.lst
      |-- default
      `-- zImage-openezx

And the content of menu.lst should be
  # menu.lst
  # default machid (used when booting /boot/default)
  machid		1740

  title		Motorola 2.4
  kernel		/boot/default

  title		A780 OpenEZX
  kernel		/boot/zImage-openezx
  machid		1740

You also need a configured rootfs in the second partition, use the modules
provided above so you can mount the first partition when running openezx
kernel.

==Installation==

Use an openezx kernel with CONFIG_MTD_EZX_A780:

Save the current kernel:
 # cat /dev/mtd1 > zImage-2.4
 # mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/
 # cp zImage-2.4 /mnt/boot/default

Check your config
 # $EDITOR /mnt/boot/menu.lst

Flash gen-blob with mtd-utils:
 # flashcp -v gen-blob /dev/mtd1

==Usage==

Hold the following key when sending via boot_usb (or powering on when
flashed).
* Scroll Down (volume -): Boot menu loaded from MMC card
* Scroll UP (Volume +): USB ready mode
Not holding any key boots /boot/default without any FB activity.


==Note for blob2 users==

If you have previosly installed blob2:
http://svn.openezx.org/trunk/src/blob/blob2/
you have your kernel in mtd2 instead of mtd1, but the rootfs location stay the
same, so you have just to dump the kernel from the right partition:

 # cat /dev/mtd2 > zImage-2.4

and go on with the prvious

==Note for A1200 users==
For A1200 (and probably others), the kernel is offset by 2048 bytes on
the flash partition (/dev/mtd6), so you have add 2048 bytes to the start of
gen-blob before flashing:
	# dd if=gen-blob bs=1k seek=2 conv=sync of=gen-blob-for-a1200
