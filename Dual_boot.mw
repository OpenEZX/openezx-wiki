The first part of the tutorial has been tested only on Motorola A780.

Don't flash gen-blob on A910, it can't access MMC on this phone.

==What is gen-blob==

gen-blob is a ''second stage bootloader'' for the Motorola EZX phones, developed by Daniel Ribeiro starting from the sources of the EZX version of 'blob' bootloader released by Motorola.

It lets you have the phone with its BP (Baseband Processor) in normal mode, this enables the use of GSM and several other services on EZX phones (GPS, if available, and charging batteries, just to mention some).

It also enables multiboot, you can keep your original software and start experimenting with the (too) many Free alternatives, loading kernels and userspace software from the external SD/MMC card (let's simply call it MMC in this document).

NOTE THAT WITH GEN-BLOB FLASHED, YOU NEED TO PUSH THE POWER BUTTON 'LONGER': For a full functionnality of the phone. In fact, BP need some delay to activate itself properly, and the original bootlogo is delayed as well, to 'reflect' this need. As gen-blob don't fake anything, you just need to press the power button for two second, to be sure...
 
==Installing gen-blob==

===What's needed===

* gen-blob sources and a proper toolchain to build it, or alternatively an already compiled gen-blob, see [http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/gen-blob/ here].
* The '''newest boot-usb built from the source on svn''', or phonetools, to flash and backup the phone.

===Compiling gen-blob===

You first need recent 2.6 kernel.
For example you can use the OpenEZX kernel:
<pre>
git clone git://git.openezx.org/openezx.git
cd openezx
git checkout ezx/current
export KERNEL_DIR=`pwd`
cd ..
</pre>

And then you can build gen-blob using the OpenEmbedded toolchain.
Assuming your OpenEmbedded installation is in <code>${HOME}/OE/</code> you can build gen-blob with these commands:

<pre>
svn co http://svn.openezx.org/trunk/src/blob/gen-blob
cd gen-blob
make distclean
source ./setenv3
PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/OE/build/tmp/cross/armv5te/bin 
./configure --with-board=lubbock --with-cpu=pxa262 --with-linux-prefix=$KERNEL_DIR --enable-usb
PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/OE/build/tmp/cross/armv5te/bin 
make

cp src/blob/blob gen-blob
</pre>

===Partitioning===

gen-blob expects a FAT16/FAT32 as the first partition on MMC card, it loads the kernel from there, you could also use this partition as storage shared between the original software and the alternative ones. The other partitions should be choosen according to the requirements of the kernel you are going to load. Usually OpenEZX kernels expect an ext2 partition as the second one, from which they load the rootfs.

For instance, here's a possible directory layout for gen-blob in the first partition:
  .
  `-- boot
      |-- menu.lst
      |-- default
      `-- zImage-openezx

With this layout the content of menu.lst should be

 # menu.lst
 # default machid (used when booting /boot/default)
 machid		1740
 
 title		Motorola 2.4
 kernel		/boot/default
 
 title		A780 OpenEZX
 kernel		/boot/zImage-openezx
 machid		1740

You also need a configured rootfs in the second partition, use the modules provided above so you can mount the first partition when running openezx kernel.

==Flashing and installing gen-blob==

===On A780 and E680 (gen1 devices)===

Put the phone in flash mode and prepare it:
 ./boot_usb setflag usb
 ./boot_usb gen-blob 0
 
Backup your existing kernel:
 ./boot_usb read 0x20000 1048576 backup-of-kernel-partition
 # Copy and rename this backup to /boot/default on the SD card.
 # Make sure the file /boot/menu.lst is in the Sd as well and point to that default kernel too.

Flash gen-blob:
 ./boot_usb flash 0x20000 gen-blob

====Note for A780 and E680 users====

The phone will "look bricked" if you do something wrong with the kernel
partition. In case you can't enter your bootloader screen, dont panic,
just remove the battery press the bootloader keys (jog+vr on the A780,
vr+vol- on the [[E680 tips|E680]]) and put the battery while holding the keys.
You will get the blue screen for flash mode.



===On RokrE2, RokrE6, A1200, A910 (gen2 devices)===

On gen2 devices, the kernel is located at a different place and is offset by 2048 bytes on the flash partition, so the procedure is a bit different.

Put the phone in flash mode and prepare it:
 ./boot_usb setflag usb
 ./boot_usb gen-blob 0
 
Backup your existing kernel:
 ./boot_usb read 0xA0000 1048576 backup-of-kernel-partition
 # Then add the famous 2048 bytes offset:
 dd if=backup-of-kernel-partition bs=1k skip=2 of=24-kernel-backup

Now like for gen1 devices, copy and rename this "24-kernel-backup" file to "default" on the /boot/ folder of the (micro) SD card.
Make also sure the file /boot/menu.lst is in the (micro) Sd as well and point to that "default" kernel too.

Flash gen-blob:
 dd if=gen-blob bs=1k seek=2 conv=sync of=gen-blob-to-be-flashed-to-0xA0000
 boot_usb flash 0xA0000 gen-blob-to-be-flashed-to-0xA0000

===Important for blob2 users===

If you have previously installed [http://svn.openezx.org/trunk/src/blob/blob2/ blob2] you have your kernel in a different place than in the original map we used here, but the rootfs location stay the same, so you just have to dump the kernel from the right place then go on with the previous instructions.

==Usage==

Hold the following key when sending via boot_usb (or powering on when flashed).
* Scroll Down (volume -): Boot menu loaded from MMC card
* Scroll UP (Volume +): USB ready mode
Not holding any key boots /boot/default without any FB activity.
