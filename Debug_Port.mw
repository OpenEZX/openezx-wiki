On the Rokr E2  and A1200 boards there are two debug ports.  One on the front and one on the back of the Rokr E2.  The one on the front is the debug/jtag port for the applications processor (PXA270).  It is located on the opposite side from the key-lock switch. The one on the back is assumed to be the debug/jtag port for the baseband.  The connector is made by FOXCONN, QT510166-L010-7F.  The male connector that you will need to access the port is QT500166-L020-9F.

The lines marked NC are either inputs to an unknown source or they are no connects.  

The ST_UART signals ST_TDX and ST_RDX, GPIO 47 and 46 respectively, are configured as a serial port in sumantra.c of the kernel and hw_init.c of the boot loader.  Please see the [[Serial console]] page to see how to wire to this UART.  

nTRST, TDI, TDO, TMS, TCK, nRESET are JTag signals.

The FFUART, BTUART, and the ST_UART all appear to be configured, but I do not know what the FFUART is connected to.
