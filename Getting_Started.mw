'''Trying an OpenEZX kernel on a Motorola EZX phone, step by step'''

This little introduction to OpenEZX should help you to boot a custom kernel on theses highly integrated and very specific devices called 'EZX phones', and finally, to test the [http://www.freesmartphone.org/index.php/Main_Page FSO], [http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Main_Page Openmoko], [http://qtopia.net/modules/devices/ Qt-extended], [http://opie.handhelds.org/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/ Opie], [http://gpe.handhelds.org/ GPE] , or '''even''', with some modifications on the kernel ([http://www.motorolafans.com/forums/android-os/21887-porting-andoid-a1200-ming.html]), the very last (partially closed source), [http://code.google.com/android/ Android], and any other (alternative) systems (or fun stuff :-) ) that can run in these Motorola's phones.


'''Please try to follow theses differents steps in the good order:'''
==Warning==


This, even if it change nothing on your original phone's software, could easily damage your phone.
Following these steps should not break your phone, but there is a possibility it could. The authors, nor the OpenEZX Project accept no responsibility for any problems (with your phone, or otherwise!) that might arise as a result of following these instructions.

As long as you don't write to the [[Internal Flash]], either to store the alternative rootfs, or change or add a bootloader, OpenEZX does not interfere with your phone's original software (though does allow you to, so be careful!) but '''legaly''', it might avoid your phone's warranty...


== A) Get boot_usb, gen-blob, and boot the kernel ==


OpenEZX's boot_usb is a tool that can be used to upload a kernel to a Motorola EZX phone, using the USB cable, doing the 'ram-loading' such as the bootloader itself. More infos at [[Bootloader]].

Note that because we're booting the phone via usb cable, the [[Baseband Processor]] starts in "flash mode" and shutdown by itself, so it is not possible to use the phone as a modem (i.e for phonecalls, SMS, etc...) or use bluetooth unless you boot the phone with [[Dual boot|gen-blob flashed]] (flashing it also bring an easier boot and USB will not be needed to upload a kernel anymore).

For a 2.6 kernel to boot due to a bug<font color=blue><sup>[[#Foot1|PXA-UDC bug]]</sup></font>, we must use a second stage bootloader : that is 'genblob' (for generic EZX blob). 

=== Get a kernel ===

* Older kernels <font color=blue><sup>[[#Foot2|oldies]]</sup></font>,(wich will maybe respond to old EZX machid: 867 ) were compiled for a specific device and maybe not work on all phones, so '''be very carefull''' (can be dangerous to try 'blindly' an old build, and support cannot be easily done)!

'''=>''' Now an OpenEZX kernel is build for all the EZX phones and you need to specify '''the right machine id''' for it to properly work on the desired phone.
See [[#Machine id's (machid)]], to find the good machid of your phone.


You can pick a kernel image in the [http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/images Wyrm's freshly built kernels, modules (.config and build logs are also avalaibles)] to quickly try a recent kernel.


For instructions on how to build a custom OpenEZX kernel, refer to [[Kernel hacking - linux-2.6]].
See also [http://git.openezx.org/?p=openezx.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/arm/README;hb=HEAD /Documentation/arm/README] in the kernel source tree.

===Get boot_usb and gen-blob===

You can download boot_usb_0.3 (SVN revision 2367) [http://openezx.org/download/boot_usb-0.3.tar.gz here].
Pick a compiled boot_usb from [http://peoples.openezx.org/gmzhuo/boot_usb here].
Pick a compiled gen-blob from [http://peoples.openezx.org/wyrm/gen-blob here].

Compiling from the sources:
Install svn, then:
  svn co http://svn.openezx.org/trunk/src/host/boot_usb/
  autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-kernel-dir=/path/to/a/2.6.27/or/higher/kernel
  make
  chmod +x boot_usb

This should have created a file named "boot_usb"
If this don't work, make sure you pointed to a configured for ARM linux kernel's tree and at least version 2.6.27.
From kernel version 2.6.28rc1, you shouldn't need to configure the kernel at all for this.

Get gen-blob's sources the same way with:
 # svn co http://svn.openezx.org/trunk/src/blob/gen-blob/

See [http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/machines/download.php] (our devices are around 1740, as you noticed) for more infos.

===Sending the kernel to boot===

First you need to put the phone in the right mode.

* Turn off the phone
* Hold down the jog-dial and the camera button, or, on some others phones, hold the VR key instead.
* push the power button
This should be enough to switch the phone in "'''flash mode'''"
A blue screen with some writing on it should appear on Gen1 devices.
A red screen should appear in Gen2 devices.

* Connect the phone to the USB cable if it wasn't done yet.
Wait some few seconds for the device to be properly enumerated by your box.

* Now '''hold the vol+''' button, then, on the computer, as root or sudo-ing, run:
           
 ./boot_usb gen-blob 0            

Ok, wait one more second then release the VOL+ key. You just entered gen-blob's "USB" mode.

You should see "'''USB Ready'''" in the top of the screen at this step.

'''Important note for gen1 devices (A780/e680):''' At this step you will need
to '''unplug/plug''' the usb cable to redo the usb enumeration or sending the kernel will not work.

* So you just need a last boot_usb command to load the kernel:

 ./boot_usb zImage-xxxx <machid> "<optionals commandline parameters in quotes>"

After a short time the screen should go funny, then you should see Linux booting!

===Optionals functionnalities and command line parameters=== 

Could be any standard kernel command line (so called "CMDLINE") parameters (in the boot_usb command they have to be quoted and separate by a space).

i.e.: Overide default filesystem type for rootfs partition:
 rootfstype=ext3
Network configuration can be overidden to suit your configuration as well with the "IP" param.: 
 ip=<client-ip>:<server-ip>:<gw-ip>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<device>:<autoconf>
Note that the last 3 (<hostname>, <device>, <autoconf>) aren't necessary to have a working setup.

All parameters are described in [http://git.openezx.org/?p=openezx.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt;hb=HEAD /Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt] in the kernel source tree.
This manual page at [http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/lkn/lkn_pdf/ch09.pdf kernel.org] can be more verbose and helpful too.

Defaults parameters (that are compiled in kernel by default) change rarely. Change them yourself for your convenience and build your kernel (it has no sense to build a kernel just for that as it's very simple to overide any parameter in bootusb command), but it's surely interesting to just take a look at them [http://git.openezx.org/?p=openezx.git;a=blob;f=arch/arm/configs/ezx_defconfig;hb=HEAD for example, here :-)] searching for that /arch/arm/configs/ezx_defconfig at the line "CONFIG_CMDLINE=".


== B) Network and NFS solution to try OpenEZX==


[[Rootfs on NFS]] is a solution to store the root filesystem, and booting your phone with linux stored in a place in your hard-disk, instead of having it on the SD card, and can be easier to experiment, to try some softwares on the phone from an hard-disk folder...
Extract the rootfs image of your choice on the "export" folder on your computer as describe below on the [[#Unpacking an image into the card]] section. Of course, doing this way, you can skip the steps partitonning, and formatting the SD card of this tutorial as well.

See [[Rootfs on NFS]] for network configuration too (computer and phone sides). (Fixme: add bridging setup)
Note that USB network in OpenEZX differs from USB networking on stock firmwares, so there maybe some changes to understand, explained in this page.


== C) Putting a rootfs image on an (Micro) SD Card to try or use OpenEZX==


For now, the kernel can boot, but does it stop to a step it search for a 'rootfs' and hangs up writing some "unable to find rootfs at:" lines? This is normal, we will try to fix this in the next paragraphs. :-)

The TRANSFLASH card needs to be partitioned into two partitions: one FAT/EXT2 partition, and one EXT2 partition used as root file system.

First partition on the Sd need to be a FAT or FAT32 partition, formated with dos, windows, or dosfstools (mkfs.vfat) on linux. It is used for media files with the original firmware optionnaly to store gen-blob's /boot folder. Of course it can be mounted with OpenEZX as well.

Second (and others) partition should be linux and formatted in EXT2 (or any other filesystem if supported by your kernel) to be used as '/' with OpenEZX

===Creating the partitions===

For this first example we recommend a first 600MB fat/fat32 partition and a second ext2 one using the rest. (My config for an 1Gig SD)

Open a shell and launch the GNU fdisk utility:

 fdisk -l
Identify your SD/MMC card, then, assuming you find this is: /dev/mmcblk0
 fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
Remember here the sd card is called /dev/mmcblk0 but this can be different on your computer.

*Delete all partition of the sd (datas will be lost), ''(push [d] until there is no more parts).'' 
*Then create a first partiton of a size of 600MB. ''(push [n]) and reply the 'wizard' in the example, we reply '1' then '+600M'.''
*Then create a second partition with the rest of the leaving size, ''(push [n]... again reply to more or less suit your needs and follow this guide).''
*Change the first partition to type "b" (vfat) ''(by pushing [t], this time).''
*Type again [t] and change the second to type "83" (linux). 
*Write the changes and exit, ''(push [w]).''

===Creating file systems, we need a first VFAT and second EXT2===

Partitions are made, but need to be formatted to be used:

 mkdosfs /dev/sda1 (for VFAT)
 mke2fs /dev/sda2
Remember here the sd card is called /dev/sda but this can be different on your computer.

===Download a recent image from OpenEmbedded===

Most of the alternatives systems (we will called them the "rootfs") have their own web pages, and wikis (see the top of this page), can be build with their OpenEmbedded's "distribution" scripts collection and images may also be downloadable at [http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/ Angstrom Distribution]. See [http://linuxtogo.org/gowiki/AngstromManual More infos on Angstrom here] and [http://bec-systems.com/oe/html/index.html for Openembedded, you can see this] [http://wiki.openembedded.net/index.php/Getting_Started or this]

There are pre-compiled images and kernels for the A780 (that might works also with others phones) in sub folders at

http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/unstable/images/a780/

For what we are planning to do any of the images should be acceptable. Choose the one you want and download it.

Note that [http://people.openezx.org Developper's web spaces] are also generally full of testing images that you just have to unpack in your sd to try :) .
In the [[Rootfs on SD]] page, there is yet another rootfs "collection".

===Unpacking an image into the card===

Assuming you have followed the procedure outlined in [[#Creating the partitions]] below you will need to mount the new partitions. As root or using sudo, type

''Assuming your card is at /dev/sda, in command line, type:''

as root, or using sudo: 
 mount -t ext2 /dev/sda2 /SD/MMC/MOUNTING/FOLDER
 
You have mounted the SD or MMC card.
Then for extracting the rootfs image, type:

Also as root, or using sudo: 
 cd /SD/MMC/MOUNTING/FOLDER/
 tar xvjf /PATH/OF/THE/DOWNLOADED/IMAGE/<NAME OF YOUR IMAGE>
Works for a .tar.bz2 compressed image, use 'tar -xvzf' for a .tar.gz compressed image.
 sync
Ensure copying is finish before doing anything else.
 cd ~/
Exit that folder before unmounting the SD
 umount /dev/sda2
Remember our SD card is named /dev/sda here, and this may differ on your own computer.

===Add softwares to the distro's rootfs===

To find how the distros package management system works, please refer to their own website (see links in the first paragraph on top of this page).
Some use ipgk, pkg systems and software package, all of them offers a lot of attractive softwares in several repositories.
Trying eabi arm binaries packages can work, (extraction of debian armel packages? ) might also work, for simple tools.

'''Footnotes:'''

<span id="Foot1"><sup><font color=red>pxa-udc bug</font></sup><small> There is a bug in the mainline pxa-udc's driver (not used in OpenEZX's 2.6.25 or older kernels that used a different pxa-udc driver and don't necessite the 'boot_usb gen-blob 0' command) that cause a "kernel panic", so the only way to use usb without any changes on this driver is to boot using a second stage bootloader, gen-blob, that "prepare" the phone in a way the driver can work with it, and not cause a panic.</small></span>

<span id="Foot2"><sup><font color=red>Oldies</font></sup><small> History: until 2.6.25, kernel were specifics to a device, each phone had it's kernel. Then developpers decided to use machid and some variables into the kernel, this succeed and gave an unique kernel for all phones. On 2.6.25, and 2.6.26 there is the first try to the 'machine independant kernel', and this was working with differents machine id's than now. (this due to a double registration in kernel's database...now fixed). Note also that old kernels sometimes don't support any commandline parameters.</small></span>
