=Submitting proposals=

Feel free to add your proposals to this wiki on your own or send it to
stefan@openezx.org.
Please do not forget to clarify the license terms of your work.

=Ideas=

*Simple design. Perhaps just some kind of symbols.
*Not to much colors. I think up to 3 are enough.


=Discussions=

The best place for discussion is the maillinglist.

=Where will we use the logo=

*The most important place is our website and wiki.

*Perhaps we use it at some later point for more artwork.
**Bootup logo.
**Inside the GUI.
**T-Shirt
**Poster
**...

=Price=

OpenEZX is a new and complete volunteer driven project at the moment, so there will
be no monetary prices. But it could be interesting for you anyway.

*We will note that the logo was design by you on our website.
*If the project gets more popular, your logo gets more popular.
*You get a free beer, or similar drink, from Stefan Schmidt. If you meet him in real life.
*Perhaps more items will be added.
