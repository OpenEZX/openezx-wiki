==Backup Your Phone Before You Start!==
[[Guides::Backups|Before you start hacking, it is CRUTIAL that you make backups!  I hope this very long link emphasizes the importance of this.  Listen to the voice of experience!!]]

There are two basic parts of your phone that should be backed up -- the firmware and the files in your flash memory (both the disk-on-a-chip and your mmc, SansFlash, etc.).  See the [[Guides::Backups#When You Don't Yet Have a Shell|When You Don't Yet Have a Shell]] section of the Backups guide on how to do this.

==Talking to Your Phone==
There are 3 basic ways to talk to your phone.
* The stock user interface you get with the phone.
* Bluetooth
* [[Guides::USB|USB]] - The A780, E680 & E680i USB port has an [[Hardware::A780::EMU|insane number of modes], but we're only going to worry about the normal USB modes.  Under this catagory of modes, we have:
** [[USB Mass Storage Mode]] - This is the mode where you can access your phone's flash memory disks (MMC, TransFlash, etc.).
** [[USB Modem Mode]] - This is the mode where you can connect your PC to your phone and use it as a modem for Internet access.
** [[USBLAN Mode]] - This is the holy mode that causes angels to sing, women to weep and linux freaks to drool.  In this mode, your phone becomes a USB Network Interface Device so that you can commuicate via TCP/IP between your phone and PC, thus, enabling you to Guide::Telnet|telnet]] into your phone.
** [[USB CDC Mode]] - You don't need to worry about this.  And if you do, then you can fill this section in.
