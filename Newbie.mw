==Backup Your Phone Before You Start!==
[[Guides::Backups|Before you start hacking, it is CRUTIAL that you make backups!  I hope this very long link emphasizes the importance of this.  Listen to the voice of experience!!]]

There are two basic parts of your phone that should be backed up -- the firmware and the files in your flash memory (both the disk-on-a-chip and your mmc, SansFlash, etc.).  See the [[Guides::Backups#When You Don't Yet Have a Shell|When You Don't Yet Have a Shell]] section of the Backups guide on how to do this.

==Telnet Access==
Any half-way descent hacker or even aspiring hacker who owns a Linux smart phone has gotta get [[Guide::Telnet|Telnet]] access to their phone!  This is the doorway to a great many other possibilities.
