Congratulations on your new Motorola Linux Phone!  This guide is meant to be a sort of roadmap to help users get started with advanced features (i.e., hacks) to get the most out of their Motorola Linux Phone.  This guide applies mostly to the A780, E680 and E680i but should eventually cover the following phones (at least the later ones, especially the A1200).  The intended audience is users from intermediate to advanced.

==Backup Your Phone Before You Start!==
[[Backups|Before you start hacking, it is crucial that you make backups.]]

There are two basic parts of your phone that should be backed up -- the firmware and the files in your flash memory (both the disk-on-a-chip and your mmc, SansFlash, etc.).

==Talking to Your Phone==
There are 3 basic ways to talk to your phone.
* The stock user interface you get with the phone.
* Bluetooth
* USB - The A780, E680 & E680i USB port has an [[EMU|insane number of modes]], but we're only going to worry about the normal USB modes.  Under this category of modes, we have:
** '''Mass Storage Mode''' - This is the mode where you can access your phone's flash memory disks (MMC, TransFlash, etc.).
** '''Modem Mode''' - This is the mode where you can connect your PC to your phone and use it as a modem for Internet access.
** '''USBLAN Mode''' - In this mode, your phone becomes a USB Network Interface Device so that you can communicate via TCP/IP between your phone and PC, thus, enabling you to telnet into your phone.
** '''CDC Mode''' - You don't need to worry about this.  And if you do, then you can fill this section in.

==Installing New Apps==
* LinLoader
* DumpFW - dump your firmware
* USBMode - app to change your USB mode
