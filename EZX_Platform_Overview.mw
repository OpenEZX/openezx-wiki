==Hardware==

===Family Names===

Bulverde refers to the Intel PXA CPU platform, of which all EZX phone models are currently a subset.

EZX family subset names and their handsets (some help here)

*A780:  [[A780]],[[E680]]
*Barbados:
*Martinique:
*Hainan: [[A1200]]
*Sumatra:  [[Rokr E2]]

===Processors===

*A Motorola Neptune LTE based mobile phone (BP) plus
*A PXA270 Xscale (AP) based PDA in one case


====Application Processor ([http://www.chipdocs.com/datasheets/datasheet-pdf/Intel/PXA270.html PXA270])====

**contains /diska and /usr/language

==Software==

===linux-2.4.20===
*MontaVista "mobilinux" additions
*dynamic power management
*EZX arm subarchitecture
*low-level drivers for:
**SPI/SSP
**PCAP Audio (mono/stereo/headset/...)
**Vibrator (/dev/vibrator)
**USB host port attached to BP
**USB device port (belcarra usbd, not gadget)
**Transflash/SD/MMC
*THREE proprietary flash file systems
**Intel VFM (hatcreek.o)
**m-systems DiskOnChip (tffs.o)
**third unknown
*A1200 and ROKR E2 have custom Selinux static kernel module called [[motoac]]

===Modules===

====mux_cli.o====
*hooks into special functions of USB host driver
*provides GSM TS07.10 (de)multiplex
*userspace has tty devices

====gprsv.o====
*implements GPRS line discipline for mux_cli ttys
*hooks into netfilter to intercept DNS packets ?!?
*provides gprs0 / grps1 network devices

====ipsec.o====
*proprietary ipsec stack (don't we already have two GPL licensed?)
*Copyright Certicom Corp


===Libraries===
*glibc

====Bluetooth====
*proprietary userspace program directly opens HCI

====GPS====
*no NMEA, no serial device emulation :(
*proprietary library via mux_cli kernel module

====UI====
*embeddedQt
*Motorola EZX toolkit
*Low-level devices (framebufffer, etc) accessable.


===Bootloader===
*EZX bootloader
*based on GPL licensed blob
*low-level initialization code (GPIO config, clock, ...)
*vendor specific USB device allows for:
**transfer of executable code from USB host
**execution of transferred executable
*serial console code is present in binary (but not used)
*PST/RSD firmware updates work by uploading a "ramloader"


==="Enhanced Mini USB" (EMU)===

====Port Modes====
*Depending on pullup/pulldown/... resistors
*USB device port
*Serial port (RS232 at 3.3V levels)
*Stereo audio signal
*500mA charger
*Carkit (easy install, professionally installed)
*Factory test

====USB Configurations====
*Official configs
**cdc_acm (serial modem emulation for host pc)
**USB mass storage (transflash and VFAT-on-TFFS devices)
*Undocumented configs
**usbnet "network-BLAN"
***Network device over USB
***Allows telnet into phone
**PST
***Mode used by PST Windows App
