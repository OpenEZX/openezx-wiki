With support for SD cards we are able to have our rootfs on one of these cards. So we don't need to touch the pre-installed system in any way. 

Harald provides a debian sarge rootfs. Please follow his [http://people.openezx.org/laforge/openezx-debian-sarge-root-20060512.README instructions].

A rootfs with OPIE is also [[Handheld_Environments|available]].
