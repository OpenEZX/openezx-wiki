With support for SD cards we are able to have our rootfs on one of these cards. So we don't need to touch the pre-installed system in any way. This is a really short description how to create your rootfs with busybox on an SD card.

SD support on [[Hardware::E680|E680]] works with Harald's patchset. For [[Hardware::A780|A780]] you need the following [http://www.maintech.de/download/openezx-transflash-a780.patch patch].

== HOWTO ==

# Prepare SD card with ext3 or whatever filesystem.
# Put busybox on it and add some dev entries. You can find a tar file with busybox, symlinks and dev entries [http://www.datenfreihafen.org/~stefan/EZX/rootfs/sd-rootfs.tar.gz here]. If you like to add the dev entries on your own:
## mkdir /dev/pts
## mknod /dev/console c 5 1
# Add the following to your CONFIG_CMDLINE: ''root=/dev/mmcblk0p1'' and perhaps ''init=/bin/sh''.
# Rebuild kernel with built-in support for fs on SD card and load via [[boot_usb]].
