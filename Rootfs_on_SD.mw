With support for SD cards we are able to have our rootf on this cards. So we don't need to touch the pre installed system anyway.
This is a really short description how to do your rootfs with busybox on sd card.

SD support on e680 works with haralds patchset. For a780 you need the following patch <link to patch need filled>.

1. Prepare sd card with ext3 or whatever filesystem.
2. Put busybox on it and add some dev entries. You can find a tar file with busybox, symlinks and dev entries [http://www.datenfreihafen.org/~stefan/EZX/rootfs/sd-rootfs.tar.gz here] If you like to add the dev entries on your own.
* mkdir /dev/pts
* mknod /dev/console c 5 1

3. Add the following to your CONFIG_CMDLINE. root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 and perhaps init=/bin/sh
4. Rebuild kernel with build in support for fs on sd card and load via boot_usb
