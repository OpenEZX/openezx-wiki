This page collects information about non-Motorola Linux-based mobile phones. This is useful as many parts of OpenEZX are probably usable for other phones, too (and vice versa).

* [http://www.imcosys.com/ ImCoSys Smartphone] (announced for June 2006) (The company reports on their webpage that the OS is an Embedded Linux. I noticed on a reseller page that it is not covered by the GPL. I sent an email to the company and it answered that in fact the phone does not base on Linux. Looks like a GPL violation or a confusion between the marketing and the development guys. I contact them again and will update the entry after the next answer.)
