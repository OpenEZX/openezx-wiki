*On A780 and E680, (maybe on other gen1 devices):
The BP is the first to be aware of the power key event,
On the key press event, BP will send a notification through /dev/mux4, it should be:
 AT+EKEV: 19,1
then the role of the userspace should be to send again to the BP the command:
 echo -e "AT+CPWR=1\r\n" > /dev/mux4
to effectively shutdown the phone.

*On gen2 devices, the power button is connected to the PCAP2 chip, there are patchs to come that will handle this.
