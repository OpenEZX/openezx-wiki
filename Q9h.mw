== Linux ==

Currently, no Linux port is available. However, there is already substantial support for the OMAP2420 in the Linux kernel (mainly contributed by Nokia for their internet tablets). 

This project will sync with the linux-omap git tree [http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tmlind/linux-omap-2.6.git].

=== Porting Strategy ===

* HaRET can be used as a boot-loader
* HaRET can also be used to map GPIO and read configuration registers
* typically one would run a small HaRET script (logging to a file), and then perform key-presses or activate / deactivate peripherals (e.g. gsm, bluetooth)
* the idea is to use HaRET to relate user-generated events to changes in register states, and to collect as much data of that sort as possible
* to start off with the kernel source
** clone the linux-omap git repository
** create your own branch
** create your own mach-type (this is what you enter in HaRET's default.txt)
** copy the generic omap2420 device, entering your mach type in the MACHINE macro
** study other board files (in arch/arm/mach-omap2) and experiment!
* the most important thing when porting Linux is to get console access somehow
* however, any kind of affirmative feedback (e.g. LCD boot messages, blinking LED) is a welcome sight
* After a console has been established, MMC / storage is usually the next priority
* The OMAP 2420 Technical Reference Manual (TRM) is not publicly available

=== HaRET ===
{Connecting via USB}
* [http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/HaRET download haret] and save it on your SD card
* on your q9h, go to settings -> connections -> usb device type, and change it to rndis
* connect the q9h to your host pc via usb
* run haret and listen for incoming connections (the listen button may be below the border of the screen as long as the cursor is not in the text box or on run listen should be selected)
* from your host pc, run 'telnet <ip address of phone> 9999' or use haret-console python script to get the haret console
(ip address can vary 169.254.2.146 & 169.254.2.210 are two known values, in Linux run 'ifconfig -all' and in Windows run 'ipconfig /all' to check address)

{Connecting via Bluetooth}

=== TODO ===

* get the basic kernel, initrd, console, and MMC working
* make a list of functional features (e.g. keypad, LCD, MMC, NAND, BlueTooth, Voice Calls, UMTS, etc)
* map GPIO and MUX control
