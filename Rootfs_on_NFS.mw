''You can tell the kernel to mount an NFS root, over the USBNet interface on a linux host box.''

====1. Configure the PC's USB Network.====

So, at first you need to load/install the modules "usbnet", perhaps also "cdc_subset".

Assign the IP address to suit your kernel's config/CMDLINE

''Example /etc/network/interfaces (for debian based distros)''
 #Addition for the EZX network interface
 auto usb0
 iface usb0 inet static
         address 192.168.0.200
         netmask 255.255.255.0
         broadcast 192.168.0.255

There is a bug on ubuntu, causing this solution to only work once at each boot.
''See [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ifupdown/+bug/130437]''

I found a workaround on this page:
''[http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/USB_Networking#Ubuntu_Issues]''

(You simply need to move ''DRIVERS=="*?"'' in the file ''/etc/udev/rules.d/85-ifupdown.rules'' from GOTO to the big ''ACTION=="add"'' line.)

====2. Install NFS. ====

On ubuntu :
 sudo apt-get install nfsboot (depends on bind9, atftpd, openbsd-inetd)
 sudo apt-get install nfs-common nfs-kernel-server

Edit /etc/export to suit the path the kernel will be waiting for.

''Example /etc/export''
''(You can add some mounting options here too):''
 /PATH/TO/YOUR/NFSROOT/EXPORT   192.168.0.202(rw,no_root_squash,async)

====3. Example kernel command line for nfs root.====

'' Please adjust for your personal needs.''
 CMDLINE_ROOT = "root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=192.168.0.200:/PATH/TO/YOUR/NFSROOT/EXPORT/ rootdelay=5"
