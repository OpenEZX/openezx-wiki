If this idea will be accepted, I propose to commit the final realization to a real designer or, at least, to someone good at drawing.

A proper vectorized version should be easy to create.

Hopefully it's clear how to read it (up and in to out). I made a horizontal and a vertical version of it. Changes aren't a problem. File is made in inkscape and is available as .SVG.

Plain and simple logo, could perhaps use a colored accent somewhere. Can be vectorized if requested.

This logos are just to give some ideas, the final logo may be somewhat different, it's just to see the main idea.
