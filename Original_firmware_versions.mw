| From Taiwan, Problems accessing sites using the Opera browser. People here have confirmed for me that with newer firmware, they can hit the sites I need to hit. Blank text messages when I check voicemail or have a new voicemail. Just a "G" in my status bar as opposed to "E" for EDGE. Display doesn't show "T-Mobile" but rather "310-260".
