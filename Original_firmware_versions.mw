== Official Firmware ==

Motorola distributes several variants of firmware for the [[A780]] specialized for various regions, feature sets, etc.

== Getting your software version ==

* Go to the dialing screen.
* Enter 'www008w'. Procedure to enter a "w" on the dialing screen:
** Power the phone on.
** With stylus go to the telephone dialing screen.
** Select the menu button (bottom left).
** Select "Insert".
** Select Insert Wait.
** A "W" is displayed on the dialing field.
* A screen opens up and shows you something like:
  R52_G_0D.43.A3P
  BP: R52_G_0D.32.B1P
  BPFlex: GSOA780T673AS019
  DSP: 62252500
  Technology: Quad-Band GSM

== Getting your software version on the Rokr E2 ==

The procedure to enter 'www008w' is a bit different on the Rokr E2.  The "Insert Wait" menu item is removed if the last character is already "w".  You need to put other digits/symbols between the "w"s and go back and delete them.  Once you have deleted all of the extraneous digits the phone will immediately show the software version.

In detail:

* Press a number on the keypad to enter the "Entering:" screen (basically the phone dialing screen.).
* Open the options menu and select "Insert Wait".
* Now insert a temporary digit (I use "1").
* Now put the next "w" in via the "Insert Wait" like in the second step.
* complete the rest of the string using the above technique when necessary.
* You should now have a string similar to "1w1w1w008w".  Go back and delete the extraneous digits.
* You should now see the software version.  

== Other methods to get your software version ==

Alternatively, via telnet or Samba look at:
 /etc/ap_version.txt
 /tmp/VersionInfo

| From Taiwan, Problems accessing sites using the Opera browser. People here have confirmed for me that with newer firmware, they can hit the sites I need to hit. Blank text messages when I check voicemail or have a new voicemail. Just a "G" in my status bar as opposed to "E" for EDGE. Display doesn't show "T-Mobile" but rather "310-260".
