== Official Firmware ==

Motorola distributes several variants of firmware for the [[A780]] specialized for various regions, feature sets, etc.

== Getting your software version ==

* Go to the dialing screen.
* Enter 'www008w'. Procedure to enter a "w" on the dialing screen:
** Power the phone on.
** With stylus go to the telephone dialing screen.
** Select the menu button (bottom left).
** Select "Insert".
** Select Insert Wait.
** A "W" is displayed on the dialing field.
* A screen opens up and shows you something like:
  R52_G_0D.43.A3P
  BP: R52_G_0D.32.B1P
  BPFlex: GSOA780T673AS019
  DSP: 62252500
  Technology: Quad-Band GSM
* This screen may go away too quickly to write everything down, but you can re-gain it easily by appending some digit to the "www008w" and then erasing the extra digit.

== Getting your software version on the Rokr E2 and the A910 ==

The procedure to enter 'www008w' is a bit different on the Rokr E2.  The "Insert Wait" menu item is removed if the character at the left of the current cursor location is a "w". You need to put other digit/symbol firts, so you can put the cursor after it and insert "w"s, after you get the "w"'s there you can delete it, and the phone will immediately show the software version.

In detail:

* Press a number on the keypad (I will use "1") to enter the "Entering:" screen (basically the phone dialing screen.).
* Open the options menu and select "Insert Wait".
* Now move the insertion point between the firt digit and the first inserted "w". (Ex. 1|w)
* Now add three more "w" in via the "Insert Wait" like in the second step.
* Insert "008" before the last "w".
* You should now have a string similar to "1www008w".  Go back and delete the first digit.
* You should now see the software version, it will show only for 20 seconds.

== Other methods to get your software version ==

Alternatively, via telnet or Samba look at:
 /etc/ap_version.txt
 /tmp/VersionInfo

== Known versions ==

| From Taiwan, Problems accessing sites using the Opera browser. People here have confirmed for me that with newer firmware, they can hit the sites I need to hit. Blank text messages when I check voicemail or have a new voicemail. Just a "G" in my status bar as opposed to "E" for EDGE. Display doesn't show "T-Mobile" but rather "310-260".
