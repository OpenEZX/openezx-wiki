=Using the A780 AGPS Module=

The aGPS module of the A780 is connected to [[BP]], and [[AP]] receive the datas through the mux line (mux14), in a binary form using a Motorola proprietary protocol. 

Antonio Ospite developed "gpsmux" to simplify all this, and retrieve the longitude and latitude in a more readable format.

'''The A780 geolocalisation only works if you have started the phone with [[BP]] in normal mode, see [[Dual boot]].'''
