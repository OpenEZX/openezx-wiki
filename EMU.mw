== EMU (Enhanced Mini USB) ==

The A780 has a mini USB connector that has some alternate pinout / functions.
There is code in the kernel sources /drivers/misc/ezx-emu.c.

== Normal USB device/accesory mode ==

Pinout :
* 1 +5 volts input used to charge the phones battery at max 500ma.
* 2 Data-
* 3 Data+
* 4 (NC/left open) voltage at adc aprox 2,4-2,8 volt (there seems to be an internal pullup resistor of unknown value)
* 5 GND

In this mode, the Data- and Data+ lines will be routed to a USB transceiver located in PCAP chip, which is connected to the AP (PXA270) via the USB2 single ended interface (GPIO pins 34,35,36,39, 40, and 53). There is a 1,5kohm pullup resistor between the D+ as required by the USB standard to signal a high speed device (12mbits). This resistor is switchable by the PCAP bit BUSCTRL_USB_PU (+3,3volt or high Z). There is a second switchable pullup resistor on the d+ line which is used for charger detection.  This resistor seems to be switched off (high Z) when setting the PCAP bit BUSCTRL_VUSB_MSTR_EN. However this does not happen instantly but with some delay (about 5-10 sec).
It doesn't happen every time I tried. About 1 in 10 times it didn't work. It apears as if the firmware of the Baseband Processor is scanning from time to time the PCAP bits and then switches the resistor accordingly. I speculate therefore this resistor is connected to a GPIO on the Baseband processor and thats why there is no code in morotolas kernel.

== UART mode ==

Pinout :
* 1 NC
* 2 TXD
* 3 RXD
* 4 ???
* GND

The routing of the analog switches is exactly the same as in USB client mode, but inside the PCAP chip, the USB transceiver is bypassed. TXD is bypassed to GPIO 39 of the BP (which is then TXD of FFUART) and RXT is bypassed to GPIO 53 (which is then RXD of FFUART). 
See drivers/misc/ezx-emu.c of the original kernel for code.

== Simple Charger ==

Pinout :
* 1 + 5 volts @ 500 ma
* 2 Short to pin 3
* 3 Short to pin 2
* 4 200kohm pulldown
* 5 GND

The Short between pin2 and pin3 is detected by a 200kohm pullup resistor on pin3 / d+ and a voltage comparator comparing pin2 and pin3.
It seems to be possible to switch this pullup resistor off by software.

== Fast Charger ==
Pinout :
* 1 + 5 volts @ 1,250 ma
* 2 Short to pin 3
* 3 short to pin 2
* 4 440kohm pulldown
* 5 GND

== Just Power on the phone ==

Pinout :
* 1 + 5 volts
* 2 NC
* 3 NC
* 4 440kohm pulldown
* 5 GND

== Headset Mode ==

Pinout :
* 1 The phone suppiles a voltage to the headset through this pin
* 2 Left Out for Stereo Playback  or Mono Out  for handsfree 
* 3 Right Out for Stereo Playback or Mono In (mix for handsfree) 
* 4 102Kohm pulldown
* 5 GND

Depending on what you do (play mp3 / calling) the phone will either switch to stereo mode or handsfree mode.
The pins are either routed to the Stereo DAC of PCAP or to a Mono DAC and a Mono ACD in PCAP.

== Factory Test & Flash ==

Nothing is known about this mode.
