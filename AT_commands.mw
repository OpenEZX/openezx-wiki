__NOTOC__

= AT command primer =

The AT (Attention) command protocol is used to communicate over a serial line discipline. It combines request/response commands with unsolicited responses that can occur at any time.

The request/response commands often use a request prefix (e.g. 'AT+CPIN?') that is included in the answer (e.g. '+CPIN="READY"'). That way it is simple to match incoming responses to requests. Note though that this is not mandatory (as is the case for the major part of the GSM standards anyways...)

We have to distinguish four+one variants of an AT command. Implementation of all variants is optional -- usually it depends on the AT command in question.

# Execute command
# Test command
# Set command
# Get command
# Unsolicited response

== Execute Command ==

* '''''AT'''<command>''

The execute command is commonly used to trigger simple actions that require no parameters. Example:

  AT+CSQ
  
  +CSQ: 22,99
  
  OK

== Test command ==

* '''''AT'''<command>'''=?'''''

The test command is commonly used to query the valid parameters of a command. Example:

  AT+CMER=?
  
  +CMER: (0-2), (0), (0), (0-2), (0,1)
  
  OK

== Get command ==

* '''''AT'''<command>'''?'''''

The get command is commonly used to retrieve the current settings. Example:

  AT+CMER?
  
  +CMER: 0,0,0,0,0
  
  OK

== Set command ==

* '''''AT'''<command>'''='''<parameters>''

The set command is commonly used to set the current settings. Example:

  AT+CMER=2,0,0,2,1
  
  OK

== Unsolicited response ==

* ''<command>''':'''<parameters>''

The unsolicited response is commonly used to indicate a settings change. Example:

  +CREG: 0

= AT on Motorola EZX =

The EZX phones support a wide range of AT commands. Some of them are official GSM commands, other are extension.

We should compare the commands to one known of the 3GPP standards:
* http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.07/0707-780.zip
* http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/27_series/27.007/27007-720.zip

Also other documents in this directories are interesting for some parts of the commands:
* http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/
* http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/27_series/

SMS-Related AT commands:
* http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/07_series/07.05/0705-701.zip

'''Note: Official commands should not be listed here. They are already defined in the standards.'''

Some of the motorola commands can also be found in command references for other chips:

====AT+EONS:====

====AT+EOPER:%d[,%s]====

Operator Registration: ''+EOPER: 5,"262-03"''

This is slightly related to the standard +CREG event. Value is not in conformance to +CREG, operator name unfortunately only available as MCC & MNC. Operating system seems to match the SIM list of operators to gather the operator code. I have yet to find out how to do that, since neither +COPN nor +COPL are implemented.

Pinging the modem.
* AT+EPING
* AT+EPING?
Execution and query command triggers answer:
* +EPING: 0

''Note'': on gen2 alarm works via /dev/power_ic ioctls ( uses PCAP2 ? )

Does not work here. I guess there is some command that needs to be sent beforehand, so that the mapping is initialized or read from the SIM.
