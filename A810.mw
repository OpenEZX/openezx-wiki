Motorola A810 is a ODM product developed by [http://e28.com E28 Limited]. Unlike its clamshell siblings, the A810 offers a standard candy-bar design, and it is equipped with a less-powerful 2-megapixel camera, suggesting that this is the low-end alternative to MotoMing.

Phone introduces E28's proprietary software stack to Motorola users, some firmware's sections (at least kernel) are digitally signed by Motorola.
