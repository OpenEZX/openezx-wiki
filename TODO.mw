= Kernel =

* find out why kernel doesnt boot with CONFIG_IWMMXT
* find out why E680 SD/MMC works, but not A780 Transflash
* debug and fix pxa27x_udc in order to provide usbnet (nfsroot!)
* debug and fix mtd support in order to be able to access system flash
* port and cleanup video and sound drivers
* port motorola-specific SSP/SPI drivers into 2.6.x generic SPI stack
* port all the driver specific dpm bits from Motorolas 2.4.20 to 2.6.x
* clean up the already working keypad drivers
* finish reimplementation of mux_cli and grpsv modules
* look into reimplementing the proprietary flash fs drivers, though I don't think that is particularly important, we could run our code 100% on SD/Transflash
* create a modified bootloader that allows for multiboot configurations. It could actually include SD/TF support for booting kernels from there.
* check how the other (later) motorola Linux smartphones differ and merge their device-specific code into our 2.6.x kernel tree

= Userspace =

* PIM applications
* Telephone applications
