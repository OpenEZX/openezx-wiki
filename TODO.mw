= Kernel =
* Stress test the 48MB ram.
* Video
** Test, finish porting and cleanup video capture driver (camera)
* Sound
** Document the PCAP2 audio registers/bits
** Write an ASOC codec driver for the PCAP2
** Write an ASOC machine driver for the ezx platform
* Power Management
** Add 'device power off' mode so 'halt -p' works
** Add suspend/resume support
** Port all the driver specific dpm bits from Motorolas 2.4.20 to 2.6.x
** Add DPM bits to all other drivers
** Test, try, fail...
* Keypad
** Clean up the already working keypad driver
** Use a reasonable keymap
** Add driver for keypad backlight (pcap-based). Question: What kind of userspace interface (if any)
* Touchscreen (drivers/input/touchscreen/pcap_ts.c)
** Clean-up touchscreen driver
* MMC/SD/TF (drivers/mmc/pxamci.c)
** Find out why 4-bit wide MMC/SD transfers don't seem to work with LaF0rge's patch
** Port various fixes from OpenTom SD/MMC stack
* SPI (arch/arm/mach-pxa/spi.c)
** Consider using ssp-interrupt-based transfers for stuff like touchscreen and only use polling drivers from within interrupt handler.  Or even better: make interrupt priorities work in a way that the PCAP interrupt chaining handler can use interrupt-based SPI transfers (unrealistic, but worth invesetigating)
* AP/BP interaction
** implement [[BP_Handshake | handshake]] procedure to put BP in non-flash-mode
** Finish reimplementation of mux_cli and grpsv modules
* Make GPS data available to userspace. The gps is connected at BP. ([[A780]] only)
* proprietary flash file systems
** Look into reimplementing the DiskOnChip G3 drivers, though I don't think that is particularly important, we could run our code 100% on SD/Transflash
* Non-A780/E680 stuff
** Check how the other (later) motorola Linux smartphones differ and merge their device-specific code into our 2.6.x kernel tree
* Extended Mini USB (EMU)
** add support for motorola-compatible cable/device detection and apropriate switching of USB device / UART / phone-powered / ... support
** think on how to do runtime device profile switching with usb-gadget and the horribly broken PXA270 UDC (read errata, it's barely useable). Alternatively try supporting multiple interfaces or configurations (also quite impossible with broken controller)
** USB host support on EMU!

= Bootloader =

* Use u-boot
** Use u-boot as a secondary bootloader
** Flash support (CFI)
** TF/SD support
** Network support
** Commandinterface over usb.
** Firmware updates.
** Use u-boot as a primary bootloader

= Userspace (Openembedded and others) =

* OpenMoko [http://www.openmoko.org/] software stack.
* Port gpsd to communicate with several gps applications. ([[A780]] only)

= Wiki =

* Get rid of Software:: namespace. Merge content in existing pages.
** [[Software::AP::Motorola]]
** [[Software::AP::OpenEZX]]
* Fill up [[Rootfs on NFS]].
* Fill up [[JTAG]].
