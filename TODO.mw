= Kernel =
* Video
** Test, finish porting and cleanup video capture driver (camera)
* Sound
** Document the PCAP2 audio registers/bits
** Write an ASOC codec driver for the PCAP2
** Write an ASOC machine driver for the ezx platform
* Power Management
** More testing with bp driver/mux_cli
* AP/BP interaction
** implement [[BP_Handshake | handshake]] procedure to put BP in non-flash-mode (i dont think its possible)
** Finish reimplementation of grpsv modules
* GPS
** Trace lapisrv on phone boot-up, determine if the GPS firmware is inside bp firmware or inside lapisrv.
*** If inside lapisrv steal it.
*** If inside bp firmware determine the command used to upload it to the GPS module
* proprietary flash file systems
** Look into reimplementing the DiskOnChip G3 drivers, though I don't think that is particularly important, we could run our code 100% on SD/Transflash
* Enhanced Mini USB (EMU)
** add support for Motorola-compatible cable/device detection and appropriate switching of USB device / UART / phone-powered / ... support
** think on how to do runtime device profile switching with usb-gadget and the horribly broken PXA270 UDC (read errata, it's barely useable). Alternatively try supporting multiple interfaces or configurations (also quite impossible with broken controller)
** USB host support on EMU!
* Use u-boot
** Use u-boot as a secondary bootloader
** Flash support (CFI)
** TF/SD support
** Commandinterface over usb.
** Firmware updates.
** Use u-boot as a primary bootloader
* Implement our own RDL software, using a minimal linux kernel with MTD support and initrd
* Freesmartphone Software Stack [http://www.freesmartphone.org/]
** Implement poweroff procedure, on SIGTERM
** Implement AP date updating based on BP information on boot.

* Fill up [[Rootfs on NFS]].
* Fill up [[JTAG]].
