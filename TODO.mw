= Kernel =

* Find out why E680 SD/MMC works, but not A780 Transflash
* Debug and fix pxa27x_udc in order to provide usbnet (nfsroot!)
* Debug and fix mtd support in order to be able to access system flash
* Port and cleanup video and sound drivers
* Port motorola-specific SSP/SPI drivers into 2.6.x generic SPI stack
* Port all the driver specific dpm bits from Motorolas 2.4.20 to 2.6.x
* Clean up the already working keypad drivers
* Finish reimplementation of mux_cli and grpsv modules
* Look into reimplementing the proprietary flash fs drivers, though I don't think that is particularly important, we could run our code 100% on SD/Transflash
* Check how the other (later) motorola Linux smartphones differ and merge their device-specific code into our 2.6.x kernel tree
* Make GPS data from available to userspace. The gps is connected at BP. (A780 only)

= Bootloader =

* Get reblob working to load another blob via blob. We can test bootloader changes fine this way.
* Create a modified bootloader that allows for multiboot configurations. It could actually include SD/TF support for booting kernels from there.

= Userspace =

* PIM applications
* Telephone applications (perhaps http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/Gomunicator)
* Port gpsd to communicate with several gps applications. (A780 only)
