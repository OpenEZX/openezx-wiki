=Flashing gen-blob on the '''-GEN1-''' device=


==What's needed==

* gen-blob sources and a proper toolchain to build it, or alternatively pick an already compiled gen-blob [http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/gen-blob/ here].
* The '''newest boot-usb built from the source on svn''', or phonetools, to flash and backup the phone (older boot-usb version could brick your phone without warnings, oldest cannot even flash and use the needed command we need).
* boot_usb must be the latest version (a previous version fails to sanitizer user input, and a small mistake can lead to a disaster !)

==Flashing. -Follow this only on A780 or E680-==

[[Bootloader#Enter_the_bootloader | Enter the bootloader]] and prepare the phone to be flashed:
 ./boot_usb setflag usb
 ./boot_usb gen-blob 0
 
[[Backups|Backup]] your existing kernel:
 ./boot_usb read 0x20000 917504 backup-of-kernel-partition
 # Copy and rename this backup to /boot/default on the SD card.
 # Make sure the file /boot/menu.lst is in the Sd as well and point to that default kernel too.

Check gen-blob's size (must not exceed 128KiB)
 ls -l gen-blob

Flash gen-blob '''WARNING: For gen1 phones only! :'''
 #example: ./boot_usb flash <address> <file> 
 ./boot_usb flash 0x20000 gen-blob

==Important for blob2 users==

If you have previously installed [http://svn.openezx.org/trunk/src/blob/blob2/ blob2] you have your kernel in a different place than in the original map we used here, but the rootfs location stay the same, so you just have to dump the kernel from the right place then go on with the previous instructions.

==Additional notes==

The phone will "look bricked" if you do something wrong with the kernel
partition. In case you can't enter your bootloader screen, dont panic,
just remove the battery press the bootloader keys (jog+vr on the A780,
vr+vol- on the [[E680 tips|E680]]) and put the battery while holding the keys.
You will get the blue screen for flash mode.

= After the flash =
* Boot with vol- pressed for the boot menu or with vol+ for the usb mode. 
* You can power off on usb mode with "boot_usb off".
* You can still have access to the flash mode with the usual combo.

==Re-flashing the original kernel, after genblob, in the device (optional)==
Re-flashing a (prepared) 2.4 original kernel require you a few minuts more, but bring some advantages...(the ability to boot the motorola kernel, and even charge the battery without a (micro)SD in the phone).

But:
* You should always do a [[Backups|'''backup''']] (possibly, a full backup) before replacing anything on the phone... 
* A little mistake could erase the partiton next to the kernel one ("resource partition"), etc...

Gen-blob always search at offset 0x40000 and if it find a special 'magic' flag, then it will boot this kernel by default.

===Prepare the 2.4 kernel to be re-flashed===

You remember? Before, we did a backup of the kernel partition (third command described on this page):

So, hopefully, you kept that backup file... :-)

Now you need to resize the file to remove the last 4 bytes:
 dd bs=1 count=917500 if=backup-of-kernel-partition of=kernel-with-no-extra-bytes
Download and add the magic flag to the kernel for genblob to recognize it:
 # download a flag to put at the beggining of the kernel before flashing it.
 wget http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/gen-blob/magic-boot-from-flash
 cat magic-boot-from-flash kernel-with-no-extra-bytes > kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0x40000

===Checks before re-flashing the 2.4 kernel on the phone===

Then you need to '''assert''' the resulting 'kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0x40000' file is '''exactly 917504''' bytes big:
 ls -l kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0x40000 
 # If the result is bigger than 917504 bytes, then '''don't flash it'''! You made a big mistake somewhere!
Then you can also check if the file hasn't been cut at its end: 

EXAMPLE 1:
 hexdump kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0x40000 | tail
 [...]
 [...]
 [...]
 00d8e80 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
 *
 00e0000
EXAMPLE 2:
 hexdump kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0x40000 | tail
 [...]
 [...]
 [...]
 00d5970 5911 000d 2c6c 0000 ddb8 000d 0000 0000
 00d5980 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
 *
 00e0000
One of these line (the last!) must end with at least a few ' f f f f ' or ' 0 0 0 0 ' like in these examples...

===Reflash===

'''If your checks has passed successfully''', then you can flash the kernel 

'''WARNING: For gen1 phones only! :'''
 #(Re-)Flash the original kernel
 ./boot_usb flash 0x40000 kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0x40000

'''Flash this kernel only with this bootusb command!''' (or only EZXflash too, if you really want but nothing else using mtd map)

Otherwise, the kernel will not be correctly copied because this is not the original mtd mapping, and we write after the end of the original kernel's mtd.
