== USB Exploring ==

On the way of trying to [[Get_a_shell]], I discovered the usbnet mode:

 AT+mode=8                                                                       
 OK

Result on the host side:

 usb 4-1: USB disconnect, address 7
 usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
 usb 1-1: not running at top speed; connect to a high speed hub
 usb 1-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
 usbcore: registered new interface driver cdc_ether
 usb0: register 'zaurus' at usb-0000:00:1d.0-1, pseudo-MDLM (BLAN) device, 56:bf:ae:e3:71:f5
 usbcore: registered new interface driver zaurus

And ifconfig shows:
