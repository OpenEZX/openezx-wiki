== Kernel ==

Linux version 2.6.10_dev(gcc version 3.4.3 (MontaVista 3.4.3-25.0.96.custom 2006-06-12))

== CPU ==

Some ARM 6TEJ according to [http://wiki.openezx.org/Rizr_Z6_Details#.2Fproc.2Fcpuinfo /proc/cpuinfo]

== RAM ==

60M according to [http://wiki.openezx.org/Rizr_Z6_Details#.2Fproc.2Fcmdline kernel cmdline]

== Getting USBnet ==

On the way of trying to [[Get_a_shell]], I discovered the usbnet mode:

 AT+mode=8                                                                       
 OK

Result on the host side:

 usb 4-1: USB disconnect, address 7
 usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
 usb 1-1: not running at top speed; connect to a high speed hub
 usb 1-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
 usbcore: registered new interface driver cdc_ether
 usb0: register 'zaurus' at usb-0000:00:1d.0-1, pseudo-MDLM (BLAN) device, 56:bf:ae:e3:71:f5
 usbcore: registered new interface driver zaurus

And ifconfig shows:

 usb0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 56:BF:AE:E3:71:F5  
          BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1494  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)

== Other modes ==

=== USBstorage ===

 AT+mode=24                              
 OK

Then get:

 Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
 scsi2 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
 usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage
 USB Mass Storage support registered.
 usb-storage: device scan complete
 scsi 2:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Motorola MSnc.                 PQ: 1 ANSI: 0 CCS
 usb 4-2: reset high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 12
 scsi 2:0:0:1: Direct-Access     Motorola MSnc.                 PQ: 1 ANSI: 0 CCS
 scsi 2:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg1 type 0
 scsi 2:0:0:1: Attached scsi generic sg2 type 0

=== MTP ===

 AT+mode=26                              
 OK

Desktop then reports it detects PTP camera.

== Enter the bootloader ==
