Todo: [[Software::A780::Telnet_Access|This Telnet Access Howto]] should be merged with this page.

----

Here is how to get a shell on the phone, using a Linux host computer. This process gets you under the hood where you can mess up your phone sufficiently that it won't boot any longer. For E680 users, as long as you don't mess up the bootloader, you can restore the phone to a working state with motorola's PST software and a copy of the firmware. No links will be provided here since it's illegal and leaked. We don't know of any A780 firmware in the wild (but on [http://www.motorolafans.com motorolafans.com], one is listed - it is completely unverified though).

If you aren't careful, you can mess up your phone to the point that it will take a skilled person to restore an E680, and an A780 might have to be sent for factory service.

This howto is specifically for Linux or Mac OS X and a specific version of the A780. For further howto's and questions check [http://www.motorolafans.com motorolafans.com].

By default, the A780 would set its IP address to 192.168.1.2. ''This won't work'' if your system already has a network configured that would include 192.168.1.2. Since this is a network commonly used for DHCP, that could be a problem.

Therefore in the [[#Using LinLoader|LinLoader approach]] below, we will put the phone's IP address to 169.254.1.2 here, and the host's IP address to 169.254.1.1. You can replace that numbers by any IP address from the following ranges: 192.168.1.* or 169.254.*.* (where the phone and the host must have different IP adresses but from the same subnet). You cannot easily use totally different IP addresses. This requires you to enable these in /etc/hosts.allow on the phone.

== Preparing the host ==

=== Mac OS X ===

On a MAC OS X host, you need the AJZaurusUSB network driver. Get it at [http://www.dsitri.de/wiki.php?page=AJZaurusUSB AJZaurusUSB].
To work with the A780, install the driver. Just before restarting, edit the tile /System/Library/Extensions/AJZaurusUSB.kext/Contents/Info.plist and add just under         

 <key>IOKitPersonalities</key>
 <dict>

this text:

 <key>Motorola A780</key>
 <dict>
   <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
   <string>org.lucidcake.driver.AJZaurusUSB</string>
   <key>IOClass</key>
   <string>org_lucidcake_driver_AJZaurusUSB</string>

   <key>idProduct</key>
   <integer>24588</integer>
   <key>idVendor</key>
   <integer>8888</integer>
 </dict>

After reboot, when connecting the phone, a device /dev/tty.usbmodem3B11 should appear (and disappear when you switch the phone to usblan mode, see below).

This is known to work when [[#Using LinLoader]].

=== Linux ===

On your Linux host, load the USB ATM (modem) and USB network drivers:

 modprobe usbnet
 modprobe cdc-acm

Go into the setup application and configure the USB mode to be '''modem'''.

Plug the phone and the host together with a USB cable. On the console you should see:

 cdc_acm 4-2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device

You can play back the console messages with the '''dmesg''' command. If you look in /proc/bus/devices, you will find a device with a manufacturer ID of ''Motorola'' and a product ID of ''Motorola USB Modem''.

== Using the modem hack ==

Install minicom if it's not installed. On Debian, I used:

 apt-get install minicom

Start minicom. Type '''Control-A''' and then '''o''' to get the setup screen.
Set the serial port to '''/dev/ttyACM0'''. Save that as the default.
Exit out of minicom with '''Control-A''' '''x''' and start it again.

At this point you can type Hayes modem commands to the phone. This is useful for GPRS, etc., but that's another tutorial.

Type '''AT+mode=99''' followed by carriage return. The phone goes out of modem mode at this point, so you won't get an "OK".

Exit minicom.

When you gave that "mode" command, the phone caused the host to re-enumerate its USB device - which looks like unplugging it and plugging it in again, but you didn't touch the cable. Now, the USB device has changed its flavor! The console should say something like:

 usb 4-2: USB disconnect, address 8
 usb 4-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 9
 usb0: register usbnet at usb-0000:00:10.2-2, pseudo-MDLM (BLAN) device, 8e:36:06:d5:16:9d

And now /proc/bus/devices should contain a device with manufacturer ID of ''Motorola'' and product id of ''Motorola USBLAN''.

Configure the network interface with

 ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 mtu 900

and log in to your phone as "root" (no password is set, simply press return):

 telnet 192.168.1.2

once you're logged in, you should adjust the mtu on the phone side, too:

 ifconfig usbl0 mtu 900


== Using LinLoader ==

First get the '''LinLoader''' script from [http://www.motorolafans.com/index.php?name=Downloads&file=details&id=35 motorolafans.com] (you need a forum account for this). Unzip and copy the following files to the ".system/QTDownLoad/'''loader'''" directory on your TransFlash (or SD/MMC) card (you will need to create the "loader" subdirectory):
* lin_loader
* loader.png
* loader-sm.png

Then edit ".system/java/PlugCardDB" (also on your TransFlash or SD/MMC card) and add the following:
  [AppLinkRecord100000101]
  AllPosition = 200
  BigIcon = loader.png
  Directory = loader
  Exec = lin_loader
  Group = 3
  Icon = loader-sm.png
  InstalledDate = 2005/11/29
  JavaId = -1
  Mime =
  MpkgFile =
  Name = LinLoader
  OsVersion =
  Position = 1
  Rotation =
  Shared = 0
  Size = 24K
  Type = 4
  uid = 100000101

The "AppLinkRecord100000101" and "uid = 100000101" should have an identical number, and shouldn't collide with any other application. Also "Directory" and "Type" should be the following for the 680 series:

  Directory = ../../../../mmc/mmca1/.system/QTDownLoad/loader
  Type = 2

Now reboot your phone. You should now have a new application (called LinLoader) on the A780.

Now place the following script called '''usblan.lin''' on your TransFlash (or SD/MMC) card:

  #!/bin/bash
  echo MotNet > /proc/usbd-switch
  ifconfig usbl0 up 169.254.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 mtu 900

This will switch you from modem mode to usblan mode, switch the phone's IP address to 169.254.1.2 and put the phone's mtu to 900.

Now set your phone in modem mode and run the script with '''LinLoader''' (long press and choose "open with").

Load the modules "usbnet" and "zaurus" in Linux. Linux should now see a Motorola USBLAN device (Vendor ID: 22b8, Product ID: 600c here).

Configure the host's network interface with

 ifconfig usb0 169.254.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 mtu 900

and log in to your phone as "root" (no password is set, simply press return):

 telnet 169.254.1.2

== Notes ==

=== Firewall ===

By default, your firewall may forbid telnet connections to your phone. Easiest way to fix that would be to disable it temporary using following command (as root):

 service iptables stop

=== mtu 900 ===

If you experience strange behavior (smb hangs when listing directories, telnet crashes on long output), set the mtu to 900, as seen above.

=== DHCP ===

Someone wrote that the device actually sends a DHCP query before it settles on 192.168.1.2 as the default address. I have so far not been able to confirm this.

=== Services ===

The phone is also running a Samba server.

The command line will be somewhat more useful once you install busybox.

=== Issues ===

There seem to be certain A780's where the modem mode trick doesn't work on, more info on this follows.
* I have a european one where AT+mode=99 outputs ERROR, plain AT returns OK ok. --ToniAlatalo
* Same here. LinLoader works, so if AT+mode=99 returns an error, dont bother and use the second part of the tutorial -- Kosta
* I have the same issue with a European A780 (not sim-locked): AT+mode=99 returns ERROR, AT+mode=12 returns OK, but I can't do anything with the reported "MotDSPLog" mode. The second option with LinLoader also works here (when linloader is installed in the proper directory) -- Rene
* Same here -- Andreas

=== Creating a backup ===

Before tinkering with a system, one of the first steps is usually to create a full backup. For the A780, this can be done with minor changes as soon as a shell login is possible. When using NFS mounts or netcat to tar the whole file system over the (USB) network, there is a small catch: the default MTU of 1500 bytes doesn't seem to work over the usbnet connection. The symptoms are that e.g. a directory listing over a NFS-mounted directory works, but that creating a file doesn't, or that netcat can connect, but that no data at all comes accross. Setting a lower MTU at both sides of the connection (I used 900 as an overly conservative value that worked flawlessly, but it will most probably also work with higher values) solves the problem and allows to easily create a full backup.

That's the reason why you should add <code>mtu 900</code> to the ifconfig commands above, and should adjust the mtu on the phone if using the modem hack.

Then I used netcat for the actual backup, you can get the utils.zip at pre-compiled at http://pashkovsky.com/e680/.

Now copy the utils.zip to the phone (e.g. with Bluetooth OBEX push), and extract it under /diska. Executing /diska/profile.txt allows to use some additional tools like netcat. For a backup, execute e.g.

 nc -p2030 -l | bzip2 -9 > full-backup-a780.tar.bz2

on the host machine and

 cd /; tar --preserve --same-owner --atime-preserve --exclude ram/proc --exclude mmc/mmca1 -cv * | nc 192.168.1.1 2030

on the phone. Then repeat something similar for the TransFlash (or SD/MMC) card (if available).

'''Attention:''' This is not a full backup of the firmware, it only contains the files that are directly visible from Linux. It will not allow to re-flash the phone using standard flash tools.
