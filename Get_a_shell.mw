Here is how to get a shell on the phone, using a Linux host computer. This process gets you under the hood where you can mess up your phone sufficiently that it won't boot any longer. For E680 users, as long as you dont mess up the bootloader, you can restore the phone to a working state with motorola's PST software and a copy of the firmware. No links will be provided here since its illegal and leaked. We don't know of any A780 firmware in the wild.

If you aren't careful, you can mess up your phone to the point that it will take a skilled person to restore an E680, and an A780 might have to be sent for factory service.

This howto is specifically for Linux and a specific version of the A780. For further howto's and questions check www.motorolafans.com.

''This won't work'' if your system already has a network configured that would
include 192.168.1.2 . Since this is a network commonly used for DHCP,
that could be a problem.

=== using the modem hack ===
On your Linux host, load the USB ATM (modem) and USB network drivers:

 modprobe usbnet
 modprobe cdc-acm

Go into the setup application and configure the USB mode to be '''modem'''.

Plug the phone and the host together with a USB cable. On the console
you should see:

 cdc_acm 4-2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device

You can play back the console messages with the '''dmesg''' command.
If you look in /proc/bus/devices, you will find a device with
a manufacturer ID of ''Motorola'' and a product ID of ''Motorola USB Modem''

Install minicom if it's not installed. On Debian, I used:

 apt-get install minicom

Start minicom. Type '''Control-A''' and then '''o''' to get the setup screen.
Set the serial port to '''/dev/ttyACM0''' . Save that as the default.
Exit out of minicom with '''Control-A''' '''x''' and start it again.

At this point you can type Hayes modem commands to the phone. This is useful
for GPRS, etc., but that's another tutorial.

Type '''AT+mode=99''' followed by carriage return.

The phone goes out of modem mode at this point, so you won't get an "OK".

Exit minicom.

When you gave that "mode" command, the phone caused the host to re-enumerate
its USB device - which looks like unplugging it and plugging it in again, but
you didn't touch the cable. Now, the USB device has changed its flavor! The
console should say something like:

 usb 4-2: USB disconnect, address 8
 usb 4-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 9
 usb0: register usbnet at usb-0000:00:10.2-2, pseudo-MDLM (BLAN) device, 8e:36:06:d5:16:9d

And now /proc/bus/devices should contain a device with manufacturer ID of
Motorola and product id of '''Motorola USBLAN'''.

Configure the network interface with

 ifconfig usb0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

Telnet to 192.168.1.2 . Wait about half a minute and you'll get a login prompt.

Log in as '''root'''. There's no password set.

=== Using LinLoader ===

working half way, information sofar:

first get linloader from motorolafans.com, you need an account for this.
unzip and copy the following files to the ".system/QTDownLoad" on your flash card:
* in_loader
* loader.png
* loader-sm.png

then edit ".system\java\PlugCardDB" (also on your transflashcard)
and add the following:
  [AppLinkRecord100000101]
  AllPosition = 200
  BigIcon = loader.png
  Directory = loader
  Exec = lin_loader
  Group = 3
  Icon = loader-sm.png
  InstalledDate = 2005/11/29
  JavaId = -1
  Mime =
  MpkgFile =
  Name = LinLoader
  OsVersion =
  Position = 1
  Rotation =
  Shared = 0
  Size = 24K
  Type = 4
  uid = 100000101

now the "AppLinkRecord100000101" and "uid = 100000101" should have an identical number, and shouldn't collide with any other app.
also "Directory" and "Type" should be the following for th 680 series:
  Directory = ../../../../mmc/mmca1/.system/QTDownLoad/loader
  Type = 2

now reboot your phone.you should now have a new application (called LinLoader on the a780)

now place the following script called 'usblan.lin' on your flash card:
  #!/bin/bash
  echo MotNet > /proc/usbd-switch
this will switch you from modem mode to usblan mode.

now set your phone in modem mode
and run the script with LinLoader (long press and choose openwith)
load the modules "usbnet" and "zaurus" in linux
linux should now see a Motorola USBLAN device (Vendor ID: 22b8, Product ID: 600c here)
you can now continue as above.

== NOTES ==

=== DHCP ===

Someone wrote that the device actually sends a DHCP query before it
settles on 192.168.1.2 as the default address. I have so far not been able to
confirm this.

=== Services ===

The phone is also running a Samba server.

The command line will be somewhat more useful once you install busybox.

=== Issues ===

there seem to be certain A780's where this trick doesn't work on, more info on this follows.

i have a european one where AT+mode=99 outputs ERROR, plain AT returns OK ok. --ToniAlatalo

same here. LinLoader works, so if AT+mode=99 returns an error, dont bother and use the second part of the tutorial -- Kosta
