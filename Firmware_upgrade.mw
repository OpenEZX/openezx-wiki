This page describes firmware upgrade process including commands and restrictions.

== How this works ==

Every motorola bootloader supports at least one feature: executing (signed) code via usb. 
Bootloader itself is not capable to flash firmware, so host tool sends (signed) upgrade agent with flashing code, called "ramloader"


== Command set ==

== Hacks ==

* RQCS can be used to dump protected memory ranges
* ADDR-BIN can be used to execute unsigned code via direct writes to stack

== Load and execute code ==

=== Without rsa checks ===

I want to load binary at address <tt>0xa00e0000</tt> and then execute. There is no signature checks in MBM, blob and gen-blob, so i can use jump
 
* use ADDR to set loading addres to 0xa00e0000
* use BIN to send first 0x1000 bytes of data
* set loading address to 0xa00e1000
* send next 0x1000 bytes
* repeat to send all data
* use JUMP to execute code at 0xa00e0000
* code at 0xa00e0000 executed!

=== Whith rsa checks using bootloader weakness ===

On LTE2 IROM3 with rsa checks i should to same except last step.

* send data to 0x03FD0000 using ADDR-BIN
* send ADDR to set loading address to stack address (0x03FEF800) - irom should report error, since its totally impossible to write to stack on such hardened device
* just ignore error and send a lot of <tt>\x03\xFD\x00\x14</tt> (address of code entry point) using bin
* code at 0x03FD0014 executed!

== Write data to flash ==

=== Native motorola way ===

* send ramloader using ADDR-BIN-JUMP
* send ERASE (erase regions harcoded in ramloader header)
* use ADRR to set loading address to '''flash'''
* use BIN to send 4k bytes of data

=== Gen-blob way ===

* send 0x20000 (flash eraseblock size) of data to ram buffer (for example 0xa0400000)
* use FLASH command to flash data from 0xa0400000 to given address 

=== RAMLDR2 way ===

* send F command to set loading address - ramldr2 should report eraseblock size
* send exactly this amount of data splitted to 1k frames - ramldr2 should report _OK to each frame
* after all data sent, ramldr should report data checksum

== Sending commands ==

All bootloaders except RAMLDR2 use same command format and USB interface. To send command you should find two endpoints (in and out) on USB interface.
On gen1 output is 2, input is 1 (0x810), on other output is 1, input is 2 (0x82).

Every packet starts from \x02, then goes command in ASCII. If there is any arguments, right after command goes separator \x1e, then arguments and terminating \x03:
