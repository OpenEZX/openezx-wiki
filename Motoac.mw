'''Motorola Access Control Policy (SElinux)'''

The ROKR E2 contains Security Enhanced Linux modifications to the kernel.  Motorola's SElinux policy is called '''motoac''', and is available as part of the GPL source releases.

== Startup ==

The access policy is enabled or disabled during startup by a "flexbit" setting in '''/usr/securesetup/ezx_security.cfg'''.  In rc2.d,  '''S10acgetflex.sh''' sets the policy as active or inactive during boot.  The policy default flex state can be checked by running this script, or by entering:

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/ezx/lib
   /etc/ac_getflexbit

The ac_getflexbit application will echo "disable AC!!!" if the default state is disabled in the flex file.

 == Enable/Disable ==

The access control policy can be enabled or disabled from a user-space application with:

   #include <linux/ac_class.h>
   ...
   int state=0;  /* 1==Enable, 0==Disable */
   syscall(__NR_security, AC_POLICY_MAGIC, AC_SYSCALL_ENABLE,

 == Firmware Default States ==

   ROKR E2    R564_G_12.02.33P    disabled.
