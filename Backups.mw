Before hacking on your EZX phone you should probably create backups of all contents on the phone, as things may break.

===Using the OpenEZX 2.6 kernel===
* At the moment there is no mtd mapping on the code on git.openezx.org/openezx.git. But in general this is as easy as running
 cat /dev/mtd? > firmware.bin

===Using gen-blob===
Download [http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/gen-blob/gen-blob gen-blob], send it to the phone with boot_usb, while holding the VOL+ key pressed, you will see "USB ready" on the phone screen, now you can use boot_usb to read flash contents.

* send gen-blob to the phone:
 ./boot_usb gen-blob 0 # Dont forget to hold the vol+ key.

* backup the firmware:
 ./boot_usb read 0 33554432 firmware.bin # for phones with 32MB NOR
 ./boot_usb read 0 67108864 firmware.bin # for phones with 64MB NOR

===Using the motorola 2.4 kernel (older method)===

'''Please note that the newer bootusb method is much more safer and you shouldn't need to use those following methods.'''

For the record:
Elvadas and Jumit wrote a backup tools in C, you can download it from [http://www.motorolafans.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=851&d=1141927886 here] from motorolafans.com, or its [http://www.motorolafans.com/forums/attachments/a780-general-chat/843d1141771345-latest-firmware-r52_g_0d-76-a1r_0d-c0-b1p-motodump2.zip source code] to use it in another phone than A780, read it's [http://motorolafans.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=27882#27882 instructions], send praise to the authors [http://motorolafans.com/forums/member.php?u=1129 jumit] & [http://motorolafans.com/forums/member.php?u=2114 evaldas] and install it! To copy your firmware, you will need to make sure that you have at least 52 MB (for the [[A780]]) available on your TransFlash drive (54,525,952 bytes). Now run DumpFW and allow it to finish (it will take a few minutes).
Once it completes, copy the firmware files firmware.dump and tffsa.dmp to your hard drive. It is advisable to notate the firmware version you have extracted as well.

Another backup tool (made for E2, but can be used on other EZX phones with some modifications), is "getos" , see [http://code.google.com/p/e2mod/source/browse/trunk/mpkg/getos/getos.lin code.google.com/e2mod].

Note that from the stock user interface, as long as you can execute/write a script, or have a terminal access, some dd command should do the backup of the /dev/mtdX partitions, and /dev/roflashX as well. Theses command should be used to write on SD/MMC some working backups of theses respectives "codegroups".
One can send these commands with a remote control access, using telnet, ssh or else (thrue the bluetooth Net, USBNet, WLan 802.11, GPRS... :-) ), just pay attention to the link quality when transfering the resulting backup files and '''prefer using directly a card-reader''' to copy them (avoid netcat! ).
