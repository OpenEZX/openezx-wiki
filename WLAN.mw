Motorola A910 has a Marvell Libertas 8385 SDIO WLAN adapter.

==Status==
Only some rough tests has been made: we can associate to an AP using WPA-PSK with
wpa_supplicant, and ssh works fine. Power consumption,
and other association schemes, have not been tested.

==How to use it==
Checkout the code and use the supplied <tt>defconfig-a910</tt> (which uses
nfsroot). A binary firmware is needed, it comes with the 2.4 code,
the required files are:
 ./drivers/net/wireless/8385/if/if_sdio/helper_sd.bin
 ./drivers/net/wireless/8385/if/if_sdio/sd8385.bin

Put them in <tt>/lib/firmware</tt> in your rootfs and rename (or link) the helper
binary to <tt>sd8385_helper.bin</tt>

Layout of <tt>/lib/firmware</tt> must be as follows:
 /lib/firmware/sd8385.bin
 /lib/firmware/sd8385_helper.bin

There are also other firmwares available on the web [http://www.avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/WirelessNetworking 1] and [http://www.pudn.com/downloads97/sourcecode/embed/detail396197.html 2], but
we don't know what difference they have.

==Note==
In original code there were some workarounds to
prevent power leakage, but I haven't understood them and hence you find
them commented in openezx code. (ao2)
