== Application Processor (AP) ==
The CPU is a [http://www.intel.com/design/embeddedpca/applicationsprocessors/302302.htm Intel PXA270]:
* ARMv5TE ARM core
* [http://www.intel.com/design/pca/prodbref/251669.htm iWMMX] extensions
* 48MB of RAM
* 48MB of DiskOnChip Flash memory
* SD I/O (SDCard/MMC/Transflash/MemoryStick/...) Interface
* SIM card interface (not used)
* SpeedStep Power management
* USB Host Controller
* USB Device Controller
* USB OTG support
* PCMCIA/CompactFlash interface (not used)
* Keypad Controller
* QuickCapture Camera interface 
* Three UART's
* [[Hardware::A780::GPIO]] assignment
This is the beast that runs Linux.

== Baseband Processor (BP) ==

The BP is a ARM7TDMI core that implements the GSM stack. Digital baseband processing is done by an Onyx (566xx) DSP core that is next to the ARM7TDMI.  Like the AP, it has a JTAG port that is connected to easily-accessible pads on the PCB.

Motorola calls the BP used in the EZX Phones a "Neptune LTE", which is an "E"DGE enhanced version of some prior Neptune chipset.  A number of non-smart GSM Phones from Motorola have only a version of that BP (and no AP).

The BP runs a real-time operating system from it's own 32MBit Flash.

AP and BP are connected via USB (AP: Host, BP: Device).  Motorola calls this USB link ''IPC'' for Inter-Processor Communication.  In addition to the usb lines, there are a couple of handshake signals between AP and BP.

== Camera ==

The A780 camera is a Omnitivion OV9640 1.3MegaPixel Camera Module. It is directly attached to the AP.

== Keypad ==

All keys and buttons are directly attached to the AP.

== Vibrator ==

The vibrator is attached to PCAP2.  The AP can program it via SPI.

== Sound ==

Microphone, speaker, ringtone speaker and stereo headset are all attached to PCAP2.

== PCAP2 ==
This is a Motorola ASIC that takes care of power management, sound and some other miscellaneous functions.  It is connected via SSP/SPI to both AP and BP.

It includes a number of linear and switching power regulators, taking care of the diverse voltage and power requirements of the various digital and analogue subsystems of the phone.

It also has the built-in microphone and speakers attached.  Audio data is exchanged between PCAP2, AP, BP and the Bluetooth chip using SPI.  It includes a Stereo DAC (for mp3 playing, ...) and a mono DAC for the voice audio.

== Bluetooth ==
There is a Broadcom BCM2035 controller attached to one the BTUART of the AP (ttyS1)

== Serial Console ==
There is no official serial console.  However, the STUART of the AP (ttyS2) can be used as a serial console.  There are two test pads (TP440=TxD and TP441=RxD) on the PCB.  Also, you'll have to pass "console=ttyS2" to the kernel at boot time (which doesn't seem possible with the original bootloader).  However, if you run your own kernel, you can easily add this to CONFIG_CMDLINE.

== GPS ==
The European version of A780 has built-in GPS which is inside the keypad.
It is a [http://www.pro-4-pro.com/de/Micro/Company-1_8084640/426f3fcdedf5f.html Motorola MG4100] single chip GPS receiver IC. An overview of the [http://www.freescale.com/files/rf_if/doc/data_sheet/FSONCOREPB.pdf FS Oncore module] (in English) is available from the manufacturer. The module is built around the [http://www.synergy-gps.com/FS_Oncore_Product_%20Preview0_4dh.pdf MG4100].

The GPS is not connected to the AP, but to UART2 of the BP. The chip supports a GPS mode called ''Mobile Station Based Assisted GPS'' in which the cellular station assists the GPS by sending the GPS ephemeris. This helps the GPS to acquire the satellite constellation quickly in low-signal situations. It takes time to get the ephemeris from the satellite because it's sent at only 50 bits-per-second. It is not always possible to decode the ephemeris without at least -142 dBm signal from the satellite, while in contrast a lower signal strength would still support position determination. Generally, the signal from the base station is more than adequate for distributing the ephemeris.

There is also a mode in which the phone need not be location-aware and the position is ''calculated'' in the cellular network using raw GPS information from the phone.

This is all tied into enhanced cellular 911.

== Charging modes ==
There are at least two different charging modes.
* Mode 1: The battery is '''not''' completely discharged. The CPU is running and can decide which kind of USB cable is attached. Power only or also data connection. In this mode you can use charging with USB data cable and USB power supply.
* Mode 2: he battery is '''completely discharged'''. The CPU is '''not''' running and so it could be not decided which kind of USB cable is attached. In this mode you can only use charging with USB power supply.
