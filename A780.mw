== Application Processor (AP) ==
The CPU is a [http://www.intel.com/design/embeddedpca/applicationsprocessors/302302.htm Intel PXA270]:
* ARMv5TE ARM core
* [http://www.intel.com/design/pca/prodbref/251669.htm iWMMX] extensions
* 48MB of RAM
* 48MB of DiskOnChip Flash memory
* SD I/O (SDCard/MMC/Transflash/MemoryStick/...) Interface
* SIM card interface (not used)
* SpeedStep Power management
* USB Host Controller
* USB Device Controller
* USB OTG support
* PCMCIA/CompactFlash interface (not used)
* Keypad Controller
* QuickCapture Camera interface 
* Three UART's

This is the beast that runs Linux.

== Baseband Processor (BP) ==

The BP is a ARM7TDMI core that implements the GSM stack. Digital baseband processing is done by a DSP core that is next to the ARM7TDMI.

The BP runs a real-time operating system from it's own 2MB Flash. 

AP and BP are connected via USB (AP: Host, BP: Device).  For some reason, Motorola calls this USB link IPC.  In addition to the usb lines, there are a couple of handshake signals between AP and BP.

== PCAP2 ==

This is a Motorola ASIC that takes care of power management, sound and some other miscellaneous functions.  It is connected via SSP/SPI to both AP and BP.

== Bluetooth ==

There is a Broadcom BCM2035 controller attached to one of the UART's of the AP
