== Application Processor (AP) ==
The CPU is a [http://www.intel.com/design/embeddedpca/applicationsprocessors/302302.htm Intel PXA270]:
* ARMv5TE ARM core
* [http://www.intel.com/design/pca/prodbref/251669.htm iWMMX] extensions
* 48MB of RAM
* 48MB of DiskOnChip Flash memory
* SD I/O (SDCard/MMC/Transflash/MemoryStick/...) Interface
* SIM card interface (not used)
* SpeedStep Power management
* USB Host Controller
* USB Device Controller
* USB OTG support
* PCMCIA/CompactFlash interface (not used)
* Keypad Controller
* QuickCapture Camera interface 
* Three UART's

This is the beast that runs Linux.

== Baseband Processor (BP) ==

The BP is a ARM7TDMI core that implements the GSM stack. Digital baseband processing is done by a DSP core that is next to the ARM7TDMI.  Motorola calls the BP used in the EZX Phones a "Neptune LTE", which is an "E"DGE enhanced version of some prior Neptune chipset.  A number of non-smart GSM Phones from Motorola have only a version of that BP (and no AP).

The BP runs a real-time operating system from it's own 2MB Flash. 

AP and BP are connected via USB (AP: Host, BP: Device).  For some reason, Motorola calls this USB link IPC.  In addition to the usb lines, there are a couple of handshake signals between AP and BP.

== PCAP2 ==
This is a Motorola ASIC that takes care of power management, sound and some other miscellaneous functions.  It is connected via SSP/SPI to both AP and BP.

It includes a number of linear and switching power regulators, taking care of the diverse voltage and power requirements of the various digital and analogue subsystems of the phone.

It also has the built-in microphone and speakers attached.  Audio data is exchanged between PCAP2, AP, BP and the Bluetooth chip using SPI.  It includes a Stereo DAC (for mp3 playing, ...) and a mono DAC for the voice audio.

== Bluetooth ==
There is a Broadcom BCM2035 controller attached to one of the UART's of the AP

== GPS ==
The European version of A780 has built-in GPS which is inside the keypad.
It is a Motorola MG4100 single chip GPS receiver IC.

The GPS is not connected to the AP, but to UART2 of the BP (one might actually wonder why the GSM cpu needs to have direct access to the GPS.  Is that some law-enforcement-location-thingy, or is it just coincidence?).
