= Flashing procedure -GEN2-Only- =

==What's needed==

* gen-blob sources and a proper toolchain to build it, or alternatively pick an already compiled gen-blob [http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/gen-blob/ here].
* The '''newest boot-usb built from the source on svn''', or phonetools, to flash and backup the phone (older boot-usb version could brick your phone without warnings, oldest cannot even flash and use the needed command we need).
* boot_usb '''must be the latest version''' (a previous version fails to sanitizer user input, and a small mistake can lead to a disaster !)

==Follow this '''only''' on RokrE2, RokrE6, A1200, A910 (gen2 devices)==

On gen2 devices, the kernel is located at 0xA0000 and is offset by 2048 bytes on the flash partition
[[Bootloader#Enter_the_bootloader | Enter the bootloader]] and prepare the phone to be flashed:
 ./boot_usb setflag usb
 ./boot_usb gen-blob 0
 
[[Backups|Backup]] your existing kernel:
 ./boot_usb read 0xA0000 1048576 backup-of-kernel-partition
 # Then remove the famous 2048 bytes offset:
 dd if=backup-of-kernel-partition bs=1k skip=2 of=24-kernel-backup

Keep these two backups, we will use them both later:

Now copy and rename this "24-kernel-backup" file to "default" on the /boot/ folder of the (micro) SD card.
Make also sure the file /boot/menu.lst is in the (micro) Sd as well and point to that "default" kernel too.

Flash gen-blob '''WARNING: For gen2 phones only! :''' 
 dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=2048 of=needed-offset
 cat needed-offset gen-blob > gen-blob-to-be-flashed-to-0xA0000
 #flash using boot_usb/gen-blob, example: boot_usb flash <addr> <file> 
 ./boot_usb flash 0xA0000 gen-blob-to-be-flashed-to-0xA0000

= After the flash =
* Boot with vol- pressed for the boot menu or with vol+ for the usb mode. 
* You can power off on usb mode with "boot_usb off".
* You can still have access to the MBM flash mode with the usual combo.

==Re-flashing the original kernel, after genblob, in the device (optional)==

Gen-blob always search at offset 0xC0000 and if it find a special 'magic' flag, then it will boot this kernel by default.

The kernel have to be prepared:
Let's do a backup of the kernel (if it wasn't done yet!):
 ./boot_usb read 0xA0000  1048576 backup-of-kernel-partition
Remove the 2048 bytes offset, and resize the file:
 dd if=backup-of-kernel-partition bs=1 skip=2048 count=917500 of=kernel-with-no-extra-bytes
Download and add the magic flag to the kernel for genblob to recognize it:
 # download a flag to put at the beggining of the kernel before flashing it.
 wget http://people.openezx.org/wyrm/gen-blob/magic-boot-from-flash
 cat magic-boot-from-flash kernel-with-no-extra-bytes > kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0xC0000
Then you need to assert the resulting 'kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0xC0000' file is '''exactly 917504''' bytes big:
 ls -l kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0xC0000 
 # If the result is bigger than 917504 bytes, then don't flash it! You made a mistake somewhere...
Then you can also check if the file hasn't been cut at its end: 
 hexdump kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0xC0000 | tail
EXAMPLE:
 00d8e80 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
 *
 00e0000
One of these line (the last!) must end with at least a few ' f f f f '...

If your checks has passed successfully, then you can flash the kernel 

'''WARNING: For gen2 phones only! :'''
 #(Re-)Flash the original kernel
 ./boot_usb flash 0xC0000 kernel-to-be-flashed-to-0xC0000
