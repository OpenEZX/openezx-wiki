The ROKR E2 is the second incarnation of Motorola's music phone.  Unlike the original ROKR E1, it doesn't work with Apple's iPod/iTunes store, but with some Motorola-own store for downloading music.

Even though we now have one E2 for development purpose, not too much about the hardware is known so far.
