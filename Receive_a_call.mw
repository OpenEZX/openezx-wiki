Theorically working on all EZX phones, tested on A780 only.

When you receive a call, the BP will send a message on the mux line 0. 

Assuming you followed [[call|the "CALL" page]] and had success to: 
*insert your PIN code
*register the network
*setup alsamixer

===Procedure===
*To listen to the mux line 0 and wait for a call, use:
 cat /dev/mux0

*If the caller's phone number is XXXXXXXXX, you'll read this:
 +CLIP: "XXXXXXXXXX",129

*To accept the call, close the "cat", or use a second terminal session, then:
 echo -en "ATA\r\n" | nc localhost 7100

*Hangup:
 echo -en "ATH\r\n" | nc localhost 7100
