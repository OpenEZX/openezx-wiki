== Note ==

* There is [http://www.linux-portal.com/phonewiki/index.php a German wiki] with other/more information on these phones. If people are willing to translate the information to here, that would be great.
* There's an IRC channel on freenode called ''#openezx''. You can find an archive with IRC logs [http://ibot.rikers.org/%23openezx/ here].
