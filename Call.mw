For the old version please look at [[Call OLD]], but it is now deprecated and may be removed at any time.

== Warning ==
Calling is under development and not ready for end-users yet, there are still bugs in BP and ASoC drivers.

This procedure doesn't work always, you may have to retry several times.

This Howto was tested only on a [[A780]].

==Prerequisites==
you need:
* a kernel built from our git repository, see [[Kernel hacking - linux-2.6]]
* a configured userspace environment whith [http://svn.openezx.org/trunk/src/userspace/ezxd/ ezxd] and alsamixer.
* gen-blob installed, see [[Dual boot]]

==Calling==

Remember to run the kernel with [[BP]] in normal mode.

Follow this commands to place a call, replace the Xs with the right values:

* and use alsamixer to set the <tt>DAI Select</tt> control to <tt>Stereo</tt> and play some stereo material. This is a temporary workaround to have proper initialization.

* make sure you stick to GSM mode:
 echo -en "AT+CFUN=1\r\n" | nc localhost 7100

* insert your pin, so to register with the network:
 echo -en "AT+CPIN=1,\"XXXX\"\r\n" | nc localhost 7100

* wait some time to let Network Registration complete and place your call:
 echo -en "ATDXXX\r\n" | nc localhost 7100

* run alsamixer and set <tt>DAI Select</tt> to <tt>BP</tt>, you ''should'' hear the other party.

* hangup:
 echo -en "ATH\r\n" | nc localhost 7100

From now on you can leave <tt>DAI Select</tt> to <tt>BP</tt>, following calls will just work.
