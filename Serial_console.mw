==[[EMU]] in serial mode==

It is possible to get a serial console without opening the phone.

You can set the [[EMU]] into a mode which acts as serial port. You get RX and TX from the mini usb plug, but need an external
level shifter like MAX3232 and a power source for the MAX3232.

In the file arch/arm/mach-pxa/ezx.c you need to enable the line emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_UART); and comment out emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_USB); instead. Also you need to add '''console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0''' to CONFIG_CMDLINE. console=tty0 is needed to see the bootmessages on the framebuffer at the same time.

Kernel 2.4 needs a change in drivers/usbd/usbdezx.c. In function cable_hotplug_attach you need to change emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_USB); to emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_UART); for serial conosle to work.

In order to login via serial console you have to make sure the following line is in /etc/inittab:<br>
T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 115200 vt100

The next patchset, ezx8, will contain a patch which allows a [[EMU]] mode switch via a config option. 

=== Build your own [[EMU]] - serial adapter ===

To build your own [[EMU]] to serial adapter you need an external 3.3V power source since the 2.775V from the cell phone is too weak to power the MAX3232.  A 2.9V supply can be used, but it is out of spec for the part.

The default color coding for the mini USB signaling is included in the schematic.

Parts used:
* 1* MAX3232
* 5* Capacitor 0.1ÂµF (= 100nF, Code 104)
* 1* [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Mini-USB_signaling Mini USB plug type B]]
* 1* [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-subminiature DE-9 female connector]]

== Soldering wires on the test pads ==
=== [[A780]] ===
The STUART of the AP (ttyS2) can be used as a serial console.  There are two test pads (TP440=TxD and TP441=RxD) on the PCB.  Also, you'll have to pass "console=ttyS2" to the kernel at boot time (which doesn't seem possible with the original bootloader).  However, if you run your own kernel, you can easily add this to CONFIG_CMDLINE.

=== [[E680]] ===
We are pretty sure that there are also test pads for an uart on test pads of the [[E680]] PCB. Unfortunately we don't get it working until now.

=== [[Rokr E2]] ===
The [[Debug Port]] page describes the connector for the ST_UART and the JTag lines for the [[Rokr E2]].

=== [[A1200]] ===
It seems it has the same [[Debug Port]] as the [[Rokr E2]].
