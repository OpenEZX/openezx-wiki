== [[EMU]] in serial mode ==

It is possible to get a serial console without opening the phone.

You can set the [[EMU]] in to a mode which acts as serial port. You get RX and TX from the mini usb plug, but need a external MAX3232 and a power source for the MAX3232.

In the file arch/arm/mach-pxa/ezx.c you need to enable the line emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_UART); and comment out emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_USB); instead. Also you need to add '''console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0''' to CONFIG_CMDLINE. console=tty0 is needed to see the bootmessages even on the framebuffer.

The next patchset, ezx8, will contain a patch which allows a [[EMU]] mode switch with a config option. 

We will update the information howto build an adapter within the next days.


== Soldering wires on the test pads ==
=== [[A780]] ===
The STUART of the AP (ttyS2) can be used as a serial console.  There are two test pads (TP440=TxD and TP441=RxD) on the PCB.  Also, you'll have to pass "console=ttyS2" to the kernel at boot time (which doesn't seem possible with the original bootloader).  However, if you run your own kernel, you can easily add this to CONFIG_CMDLINE.
=== [[E680]] ===
We are pretty sure that there are also test pads for an uart on test pads of the [[E680]] PCB. Unfortunately we don't get it working until now.
