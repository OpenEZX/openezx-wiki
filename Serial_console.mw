It is possible to get a serial console without opening the phone.

You can set the [[EMU]] in to a mode which acts as serial port. You get RX and TX from the mini usb plug, but need a external MAX3232 and a power source for the MAX3232.

Also you need to enable this emu mode in the kernel.

We will update this information within the next days.

In the file arch/arm/mach-pxa/ezx.c you need to enable the line emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_UART); and comment out emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_USB); instead.
