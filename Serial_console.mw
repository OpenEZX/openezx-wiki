There is no official serial console.  However, the STUART of the AP (ttyS2) can be used as a serial console.  There are two test pads (TP440=TxD and TP441=RxD) on the PCB.  Also, you'll have to pass "console=ttyS2" to the kernel at boot time (which doesn't seem possible with the original bootloader).  However, if you run your own kernel, you can easily add this to CONFIG_CMDLINE.


It is possible to get a serial console without opening the phone.

You can set the [[EMU]] in to a mode which acts as serial port. You get RX and TX from the mini usb plug, but need a external MAX3232 and a power source for the MAX3232.

Also you need to enable this emu mode in the kernel.

We will update this information within the next days.

== Enable emu serial mode in the kernel ==

In the file arch/arm/mach-pxa/ezx.c you need to enable the line emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_UART); and comment out emu_switch_to(EMU_SWITCH_TO_USB); instead.
