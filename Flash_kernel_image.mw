'''Big fat warning:''' Flashing a new kernel into your phone is irreversible at the moment.

The only known way to flash a new kernel image is from the original motorola system.

You need to get [http://cyph.marcuslee.org/flashkit-0.1.zip cyphs flashkit] and the source for his [http://cyph.marcuslee.org/rwflash-0.1.tar.bz2 rwflash kernel module].

The flashkit has a precompiled rwflash module  onboard, but unfortunately this one has a bug don't allowing to flash a kernel image. This bug is fixed in the source of rwflash. 

In order to get the kernel module compiled you need the motorola 2.4 kernel source and a working crosscompile toolchain. Please read [[Crosscompile]].

Just replace the old module with the new one and follow the flashkit README.

If your phone is unlocked, you can flash your own zImage into /dev/mtd4 . But be aware that the size of you zImage could not be higher then 900kbyte.
