== GPS ==
The European version of [[A780]] has built-in GPS which is inside the keypad.
It is a [http://www.macropol.com.pl/FTP_WWW/MOTOROLA/GPS_ONCORE/M12%20Plus/instantgpsbroschure.pdf single chip] GPS receiver IC. An overview of the [http://oem-gps.com/images/stories/pdf/fsbrochure.pdf FS Oncore module] (in English) is available from the manufacturer. The module is built around the [http://www.macropol.com.pl/FTP_WWW/MOTOROLA/FS_Oncore/fs_prod_preview.pdf MG4100].

The GPS is not connected to the AP, but to UART2 of the BP. The chip supports a GPS mode called ''Mobile Station Based Assisted GPS'' in which the cellular station assists the GPS by sending the GPS ephemeris. This helps the GPS to acquire the satellite constellation quickly in low-signal situations. It takes time to get the ephemeris from the satellite because it's sent at only 50 bits-per-second. It is not always possible to decode the ephemeris without at least -142 dBm signal from the satellite, while in contrast a lower signal strength would still support position determination. Generally, the signal from the base station is more than adequate for distributing the ephemeris.

There is also a mode in which the phone need not be location-aware and the position is ''calculated'' in the cellular network using raw GPS information from the phone.

This is all tied into enhanced cellular 911.


A GPS chip is only available in the A780.

The following information is only useful for the original Motorola 2.4 kernel. There is no GPS access on the 2.6 kernel yet.

mack has been able to activate the GPS and get a stream of raw data from it by talking to /dev/mux14, emulating lapisrv. Floe built on that by writing [http://www.motorolafans.com/MotorolaFansPHPbb/viewtopic.php?t=3221 gpsdump], a tool to decode the messages. lurker has written a [http://www.motorolafans.com/MotorolaFansPHPbb/viewtopic.php?t=3221 minimalistic gpsd implementation] based on Floe's gpsdump, which could theoretically work with [http://qpegps.sourceforge.net/ qpegps].
