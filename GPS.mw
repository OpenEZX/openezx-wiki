A GPS chip is only available in the A780.

The following information is only usefull for the original Motorola 2.4 kernel. There is no GPS access on the 2.6 kernel yet.

mack has been able to activate the GPS and get a stream of raw data from it by talking to /dev/mux14, emulating lapisrv. Floe built on that by writing [http://www.motorolafans.com/index.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=3221 gpsdump], a tool to decode the messages. lurker has written a [http://www.motorolafans.com/index.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=3221 minimalistic gpsd implementation] based on Floe's gpsdump, which could theoretically work with [http://qpegps.sourceforge.net/ qpegps].
