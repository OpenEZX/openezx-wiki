== handshake / interaction pins between AP and BP. ==

* GPIO_BB_WDI2:
** if this ever goes LOW during or before handshake, we power off the AP.
** has FALLING_EDGE IRQ handler, which powers down the phone

* GPIO_BB_WDI:
** only if CONFIG_PM: interrupt handler that queues KRNL_BP_WDI event

* GPIO_BP_RDY:
** has irq handler, during handshake BOTH_EDGES, after handshake FALLING edge
** as long as handshake is not completed, calls handshake()
** if handshake has just completed, disable WDI2 irq and reconfig RDY to FALLING
** if handshake is over, submit read urb


== handshake itself ==

* step1 (blob):
** MCU_INT_SW as input, BP_RDY as input
** if they both come up as high, increment step and break
** if timeout exceeded, power off
** '''this step requires that you keep the power button pressed.'''

* step2 (kernel):
** if BP_RDY == LOW
*** config INT_SW as output, set it to LOW
*** increment step
*** '''The BP watchdog timer starts after completing step2.'''

* step3 (kernel):
** if (BP_RDY == HIGH)
*** increment step
*** delay_backlight? (timer in 0.3sec), switches on bklight
*** set INT_SW to HIGH
